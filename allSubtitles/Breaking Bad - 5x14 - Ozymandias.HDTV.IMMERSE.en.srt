'Cause I just got six more exactly like.</i>

00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:15,123
I've got Jesse in sight, and
he's coming for me right now.

00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:16,719
- Where are you?

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,762
<i>Jack, don't come.</i>

8
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:20,050

Jack, don't do it!

12
00:00:46,853 --> 00:00:48,487
Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:51,574
Yo, so what's next?

14
00:00:51,608 --> 00:00:53,025
We wait.

15
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:57,947
You don't got, like, eight more
anal things we gotta do first?

16
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,448
The reaction has begun.

17
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:02,001
Yeah, I-- I know.

18
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:03,452
So how long?

19
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:04,787
Well, if we had a freezer,

20
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,989
the condensed liquid
would cool more quickly,

21
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:08,507
because, of course,

22
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:10,993
this is an exothermic reaction,

23
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,328
which means "giving off heat,"

24
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:15,514
and our desired product is...

25
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:19,218

why don't you?

00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:21,470

No, no, no.

30
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:38,237

doing the receipts right.

He's-- he's got a stick

He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

42
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:29,038
So anyway,
he's insisting that I--

43
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:33,258
He's demanding
that I stay and, uh,

44
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:35,010
look over his system,

45
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:37,262

What's going on?

00:02:54,814 --> 00:02:56,031
<i>Nothing much.</i>

54
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:59,401
I-- I was--
I was just, um,

55
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:02,121
calling to...
say I'm sorry,

56
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:04,289
but I'm gonna be late tonight.

57

Bogdan.
He's got a bug up his butt.

58
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,112

anything special for dinner.

59

So...

60
00:03:11,164 --> 00:03:13,215
In fact,
you could take pity on us

61
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:14,500
and bring a pizza home.

62

They're having
a two-for-one at Venezia's,

63
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:20,639

eat a whole one by myself.

64
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:21,807
Yeah, yeah, sure.

65
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:24,059
I can--
I can pick up a pizza.

66

won't keep me too late.

00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:42,911
Yeah, and I got nine bucks

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,879
Just feels right, you know?

83
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,514
It's my new favorite.

84
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:05,333

for sure.

88
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:16,695
maybe we can have a little
family time this weekend?

00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:19,181
Yeah, you know.

91
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,866

93
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,654

the Turquoise Trail,

94
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,657
stop at tinker town, maybe
grab some lunch in Madrid.

95

Oh, my God.
We haven't been there in forever.

96

It's growing on me.

Yep. Me too.

101
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,725
All right,
well, I had better go

102
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,710

[Frankie] - No.

you had a DEA agent

80 million.

179
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:26,047
So that's what got
this party started, huh?

180
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:28,883
But this money of yours
won't do me much good in prison.

00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,518
[Walt] You can go anywhere.

182
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:33,187
You can do anything.
Think about it.

183
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:38,109
You can have any future
that you want.

184
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,228
Jack.

185
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:43,614
80... million.

186
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,235
And all you've got to do

187
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:49,537
is let him go.

188
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:51,272
That's a hell of an offer.

189
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,958
What do you think, Fed?

190
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,710
Would you take that deal?

191
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,279
It's Hank.

192
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:03,084
His name is Hank.

193
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:06,153
How about it, Hank?

194
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:07,630
<i>Should I let you go?</i>

195
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,464
My name is ASAC Schrader.

196
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:18,966
And you can go fuck yourself.

197
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:24,906
Hank... listen to me.

198
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,074
You gotta tell him.

199
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,277
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

200
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:32,580
Please. Please.

201
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:36,050
What?
You want me to beg?

202
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,655
You're the smartest guy
I ever met.

203
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:46,594
And you're too stupid to see...

204
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:48,963
he made up his mind
ten minutes ago.

205
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,224
Do what you're gonna do.

206
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:03,444
[Gunshot echoes]

207
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,561
[Walt whimpers]

208
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,014
[Jack]
Pretty specific directions.

209
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:42,216
You know, most people
tell me to be somewhere,

210
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,434
they say, "West on the 40,

211
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:46,404
this or that exit,
second gas station on the left."

212
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:47,855
You know?

213
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:51,492
This here?
This is a whole other story.

214
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:52,576
That fancy phone of yours,

215
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,862
where does it say
this is exactly?

216
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,369
Yeah...

217
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:09,760
Look at this.
Even brought a shovel.

218
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,847
[Frankie] Jack.
No sign of Pinkman.

219
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:19,220
All right.

220
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,389
Says this is it right here.

221
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:23,557
So dig.

222
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:39,240
[Clunk]

223
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:41,792
[Laughter]

224
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,135
[Kenny]
What's that? A barrel?

225
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:53,971
Couple barrels?

226
00:12:58,626 --> 00:12:59,844
[Laughs]
Jesus.

227
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:00,895
Hell yeah!

228
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,346
Oh, Jesus.
Would you look at that?

229
00:13:02,397 --> 00:13:03,397
[Laughter]

230
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,483
Hell yeah!
Goddamn.

231
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:08,269
Whoo!

232
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:13,157
What are you waiting for?

233
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:14,909
Yeah, boss.

234
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:15,943
Hell yeah.

235
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:16,977
Let me get on this side.

236
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:17,995
Out of there, man.

237
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:20,664
Oh...

238
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,171
[Muttering quietly]

239
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:04,708
Okay.

240
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,328
Pull a barrel off the truck
and load it in the Chrysler.

241
00:14:07,362 --> 00:14:08,829
Seriously?

242
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,998
Jack.

243
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:13,200
That's, like,
10 or 11 million right there.

244
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,718
You sure you wanna do that?

245
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,554
You gonna make me say it again?

246
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:19,056
Go. Go. Chop, chop.

247
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,758
Jesus. What's with
all the greed here?

248
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:23,761
It's unattractive.

249
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:30,434
Hey.

250
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:31,902
Hey.

251
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,104
I'm leaving you a barrel.

252
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:37,775
Boys are gonna load it for you.

253
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:40,027
You got the keys
for these cuffs?

254
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,535
[Handcuffs rattle]

255
00:14:51,206 --> 00:14:53,174
I'm sorry for your loss.

256
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,247
My nephew here,
he respects you.

257
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:01,915
He would never forgive me

258
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:07,354
if things...
went another way.

259
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,439
Also, I'll be honest,

260
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:09,890
you caught me
in one hell of a good mood.

261
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:11,258
So here's what's gonna happen.

262
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:12,476
You're gonna get in your car

263
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:15,112
and you're gonna
drive out of here.

264
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,147
All right?

265
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,234
No hard feelings.

266
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:23,270
Understand me?

267
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,373
We square?

268
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,375
Hey, man,
I gotta know we're square.

269
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,611
Or we're gonna have
to go that other way.

270
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,272
Pinkman.

271
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:52,516
Pinkman.

272
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,315
You still owe me.

273
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:59,440
If you can find him,
we'll kill him.

274
00:16:02,477 --> 00:16:04,811
Found him.

275
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,753
[Breathing heavily]

276
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:15,422
[Jesse] No!

277
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:18,125
Get off me!

278
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,710
Get off!

[Grunts]

280
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:24,798
No. No.

[Gun cocks]

282
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:41,949
Good to go?

283
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:50,074
Hey, Uncle Jack.

284
00:16:56,665 --> 00:17:01,218
Well, he was out here
with those feds.

285
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:02,419
Right?
Working with them.

286
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,537
Shouldn't we maybe find out

287
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,139
what he told them first?

288
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:08,225
'Cause, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff

289
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:11,895
that might not
be too good for us.

290
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,066
And I'll bet we could
get it out of him back home.

291
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,219
I mean, I can do it.

292
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:23,023
Me and him, we got--
we got history.

293
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,727
And then, you know,

294
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:31,081
we'd take care
of the job after that.

295
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,117
Works for me.
Work for you?

296

- Let's go.
- No.

No!

No!

300
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,014
Wait.

301
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,860
I watched Jane die.

302
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:10,437
I was there.

303
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:13,774
And I watched her die.

304
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:20,297
I watched her overdose
and choke to death.

305
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:23,667
I could have saved her.

306
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:26,754
But I didn't.

00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:59,761
Hi.

317
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,565
Hello.

318
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,783
That truck belong to you?

319
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,605
It does.

320
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:12,608
I'd like to buy it.

321
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,776
It's not for sale.

323
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,386
Hey, Walt, it's me.

324
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,222
Um, just thought
I'd try you again.

325
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,608
We were just wondering
when you thought you'd be back,

326
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:51,897
so, um, just give us a call
whenever you can.

327
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,900
Bye.

328
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,868
Hey, Aunt Marie.

329
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,871
Hey, sweetie.

330
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,490
I haven't seen you for a while.

331
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:02,708
What have you been up to?

332
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,043
Oh, you know.
This and that.

333
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:06,244
Your mom and I need to talk,

334
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,947
so... thought I'd stop by.

335
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:12,117
Well, I, uh,
wish you'd called first.

336
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,720
This isn't the best time.

337
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:17,255
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

338
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,290
Why don't we go
into your office?

339
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,516
I-- I got it.

340
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,519
Okay, honey.
Thanks.

341
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,484
Marie, I have nothing to say.

342
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:47,669
Well, I do.

343
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:50,923
So you can just
sit there and listen.

344
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,793
I got a call from Hank.

345
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,328
He arrested Walt
three hours ago.

346
00:24:57,347 --> 00:24:58,714
It's over.

347
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,883
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

348
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,802
Hank and Steve Gomez

349
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,188
are working with
a former associate of Walt's,

350
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:09,224
Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know,

351
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,859
and Pinkman has supplied them

352
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:14,196
with everything they need.

353
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,066
Hank is booking Walt
as we speak.

354
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,569
And I, for one,
could not be happier.

355
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,327
I almost didn't come here.

356
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,631
Christ, I barely
even know who you are,

357
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,765
and I sure as hell don't know

358
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,001
if I can ever trust you again.

359
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,211
And then I think about
how you are so upset with Walt

360
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:49,081
and how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

361
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,483
and all of this
makes me believe

362
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,952
that there has got
to be hope for you,

363
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:57,255
that whatever
he did to you can be undone.

364
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:06,431
All I know-- all I have been
forcing myself to remember,

365
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,166
is that you are my sister.

366
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,304
And so I'm here.

367
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,309
Marie.

368
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,343
Everything changes now.

369
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,680
And you have got
to prepare yourself.

370
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,415
Hank will help you
as much as he can.

371
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:25,434
I know he will.

372
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:29,971
And... I will support you
through this.

373
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:33,442
But I have conditions.

374
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:34,476
I want you to give me

375
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,894
every single copy
of that obscenity

376
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,596
that the two of you made
to discredit Hank.

377
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,101
That DVD.
Every single copy.

378
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,737
You understand me?

379
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,572
Answer me.
Do you understand me?

380
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:50,542
Yes.

381
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:54,446
Good.

382
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,082
Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here,

383
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,885
because you are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything, Skyler.

384
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,155
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

385
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,656
Not a bunch
of uniformed strangers.

386
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,476
No. No.
No, he cannot-- No.

387
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,129
You tell him. Or I will.

388
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:13,265
There's no way around this.

389
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,935
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

390
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,205
[Sighs]

391
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:37,622
[Whimpering]

392
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,138
No.
[Groaning]

393
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:12,624
Look, I gave you
what you wanted.

394
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,993
Come on.
Man, please.

395
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,461
Hey, please.

396
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,047
I told you where
to find the tape, okay?

397
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,416
Hey, just-- just-- just go.

398
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,751
Just-- just go there.

399
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,219
Just go to his house
and get it.

400
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:25,253
We're on it.

401
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,756
Get it!

402
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,925
No one else knows about it.

403
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:31,760
Just me and his partner.

404
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:32,811
[Todd] Okay.

405
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,013
No one else knows!
I swear!

406
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,022
[Groans]

407
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,563
[Grunts]

408
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,828
Let's cook.

409
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:43,854
You're completely
out of your mind.

410
00:30:43,888 --> 00:30:45,422
It's the truth.

411
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:46,507
It is, Flynn.

412
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,959
Then both of you
are out of your minds.

413
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:50,661
You're full of shit,
is what you are.

414
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:51,679
Both of you.

415
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:53,631
If-- if this is true,

416
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:55,883
then how could you
keep this a secret?

417
00:30:55,934 --> 00:31:01,555
I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

418
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:03,140
I'll be asking myself that

419
00:31:03,174 --> 00:31:04,858
for the rest of my life.

420
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,394
So you're saying
all of this time

421
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:09,029
you were lying about this?

422
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:11,014
I mean, so you're saying...

423
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:12,316
you're a liar.

424
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,451
You-- you just admitted it.

425
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:18,288
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

426
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,040
Which lie is it?

427
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,793
Flynn, honey, your mother
is telling you the truth.

428
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:25,412
Right here, right now.
Believe it.

429
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:26,863
You know what?

430
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,865
This-- this is bullshit.

431
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,501
This is bullshit.

432
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,969
I wanna talk to dad.

433
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:33,537
Your dad's in custody.

434
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,639
You won't be able to talk to him
for a while, sweetie.

435
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:36,757
I'm calling Uncle Hank.

436
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,142
I've tried.
He's not answering.

437
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,978
Probably because he is in the
thick of it with your father.

438
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:44,014
Honey, I know this is a lot
to process, Flynn,

439
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:45,099
but if you could just breathe.

440
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,934
Just try to breathe,
and just trust--

441
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:49,820
Really? Really?
Try to breathe?

442
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:53,724
Oh, my God.

443
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:56,577
[Door closes]

444
00:31:58,462 --> 00:31:59,595
Go home.

445
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,047
Just take the kids home, okay?
Go home and regroup.

446
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:04,403
I'll stop by later.

447
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:27,624
[Bell dinging]

448
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:37,634
[Dinging continues]

449
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:41,004
Flynn?

450
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,807
Could you put
your seatbelt on please?

451
00:32:43,841 --> 00:32:47,027
[Dinging continues]

452
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:50,363
Please.
It's not safe.

453
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:52,649
You're shittin' me, right?

454
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:00,991
If all this is true
and you knew about it,

455
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:04,127
then-- then you're
as bad as him.

456
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:16,890
[Skyler] Whose truck is that?

457
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:25,649
[Walter, Jr.]
Dad?

458
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:27,017
Listen.

459
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:30,353
I need you to come inside
and pack right now.

460
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:33,440
Mom, Aunt Marie, they said
that you were arrested?

461
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:34,774
No, just--

462
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:37,027
They say that you're
some kind of drug dealer?

463
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:38,445
No, just come inside,
please. Now.

464
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:39,663
Come inside. Come on.

465
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:41,698
[Walt] Go, go, go, go.

466
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:44,251
[Walter, Jr.] Dad, stop.
Just talk to me please.

467
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:45,619
Our priority
right now is to pack.

468
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,570
Uncle Hank,
they said he arrested you?

469
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:50,240
I will discuss
all of this later, okay?

470
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:51,291
Just tell me what--

471
00:33:51,342 --> 00:33:52,759
Just listen to me!

472
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:54,511
I need you to go
into your bedroom right now

473
00:33:54,545 --> 00:33:55,962
and grab anything
that's important.

474
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:57,214
You understand?
Go. Now.

475
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,882
Both of you.
Go.

476
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:02,585
Walt.

477
00:34:02,603 --> 00:34:04,271
Why are you here?

478
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:06,756
Skyler, please,
will you just go get your things?

479
00:34:06,774 --> 00:34:08,358
For you and the kids.
Right now.

480
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:09,592
This is our priority.

481
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,061
Hank had you in custody.

482
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:13,697
- He wouldn't just let you go.
- I--

483
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:14,698
Where is he?

484
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:15,899
- I--
- Where's Hank?

485
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:17,867
I...

486
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:19,486
I negotiated...

487
00:34:19,537 --> 00:34:20,537
Negotiated?

488
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:21,571
Uh, yes.

489
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:25,242
What does that mean?

490
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:26,960
It means...

491
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:28,662
we're fine, okay?

492
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:30,280
We are. We're fine.

493
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:31,965
Everything is gonna be fine,

494
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,667
but we need to leave right now.

495
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:34,918
All right?
Can we do that?

496
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:36,469
What happened?

497
00:34:36,504 --> 00:34:38,505
Where is Hank?

498
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:40,173
Why do we need to leave?

499
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:43,843
I need both of you to trust me.

500
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:45,929
Right now, okay?

501
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:48,131
Please just work with me here

502
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:51,935
and I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?

503
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,855
Where... is... hank?

504
00:35:00,278 --> 00:35:01,854
Skyler.

505
00:35:04,865 --> 00:35:09,703
I have $11 million in cash

506
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:12,088
right outside.

507
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:15,091
We can have a fresh start.

508
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:18,461
Whole new lives.

509
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:21,514
All we have to do is go.

510
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:24,384
We have to go right now.

511
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:27,053
That's all we have to do.

512
00:35:30,174 --> 00:35:33,026
You killed him.

513
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:39,282
You killed Hank.

514
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:40,450
What?

515
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:41,484
No. No. No.

516
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:42,485
You killed him.

517
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,787
No, no. No!
[Gasps]

518
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:45,789
I tried to save him.

519
00:35:45,823 --> 00:35:48,158
Uncle Hank
is dead? I--

520
00:35:48,192 --> 00:35:49,626
Mom, it can't be true.

521
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,294
- Just stop, please.
- It just can't be true.

522
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,997
Everything-- everything
is gonna be okay.

523
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:55,715
Everything's gonna be fine.
I promise you.

524
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,384
But we need to leave right now.

525
00:35:57,418 --> 00:36:00,470
Dad, what's going on?
Talk to me.

526
00:36:00,504 --> 00:36:03,340
Just stop for one second.

527
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:05,141
Look, I told you
to get your things.

528
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:06,426
Stop walking away.

529
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:07,477
There is no time

530
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:08,978
tell me about Uncle Hank.

531
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:10,013
No, just drop it!

532
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:11,547
But-- what's wrong
with you?

533
00:36:11,565 --> 00:36:13,900
We're going.
We're going right now.

534
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:15,352
You have to tell me.
Dad, wait.

535
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:16,986
What happened to Uncle Hank?
What--

536
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:25,895
Get out.

537
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:28,865
Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.

538
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:29,899
Enough.

539
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:32,802
Mom, what are you doing?

540
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:35,038
Skyler,
put the knife down please.

541
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:36,239
I promise you,
everything--

542
00:36:36,257 --> 00:36:40,927
Don't say one more word.

543
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:45,348
Get out of here.
Now.

544
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:46,633
