2
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:04,258
We found a notebook.

3
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:05,822
<i>I wonder if you might take a look.</i>

4
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:08,542
I'm supposed to straighten up
and fly right or toe the line

5
00:00:08,635 --> 00:00:09,925
<i>or some other crap?</i>

6
00:00:10,015 --> 00:00:11,473
<i>My drug-addicted partner
doesn't seem to care</i>

7
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:12,685
<i>whether he lives or dies.</i>

8
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:15,199
<i>How long before Gus decides
that he's too big of a risk?</i>

9
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:17,770
It's Pinkman.
He's become increasingly incautious.

10
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:19,295
<i>Something's got to be done.</i>

11
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:22,559
You think this Gale person
is your Heisenberg?

12
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:24,073
Jesse!

13
00:00:33,114 --> 00:00:34,847
Say you understand.

14
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:36,583
Do you understand?

15
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:38,884
Tell me you understand, Saul!

16
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,120
Every dollar--

17
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:44,022
If you don't hear from me
in 24 hours--

18
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:46,092
No, no. Saul. Saul, shut up.

19
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:48,428
Shut up and listen to me.

20
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:51,431
I want you to give her
every last dollar.

21
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:53,903
I don't care if you have
to stuff it in trash bags.

22
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:55,272
Just make sure
she gets everything.

23
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,574
All right?
Just make it happen!

24
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:18,597
<i>Hi.
You've reached the White family.</i>

25
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:20,065
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

26
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:21,866
Uh...

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,468
Hey. It's me.

28
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:26,036
Um...

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,038
I-- I...

30
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:29,272
I just wanted to say

31
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,207
that I was thinking about you

32
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:33,408
and the kids, and, uh...

33
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:36,711
I love you.

00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,474
Hello. Would you like to try

36
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,843
our Breakfast Chicken
Chalupa Combo Meal?

37
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:18,977
Gus Fring.

38
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,712
Excuse me?

39
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:23,615
Gustavo Fring, your boss, now.

40
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:24,917
Please.

41
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:26,185
Mr. Fring
isn't here right now.

42
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:27,853
- Is there something I'm able--
- He's here.

43
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:30,423
His car's parked out front.
He's here.

44
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:32,125
He was here.
Mr. Fring was--

45
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,392
You just go in the back

46
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:35,194
and you tell him
it's Walter White.

47
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:36,262
Understand?

48
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:40,166
He'll know what it's about.

49
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:45,072
I'll wait.

50
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,410
Hello.

51
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:05,279
<i>Walter, what
exactly are you doing?</i>

52
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:08,416
Where's Jesse?

53
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,719
<i>Jesse's with me.
He's fine.</i>

54
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:13,188
Do you expect me
to just believe that?

55
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:15,257
<i>I'm crossing my heart, Walter.</i>

56
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,926
Where is he?

57
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,861
<i>Hold on.</i>

58
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,364
<i>Yo.</i>

59
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:22,432
Jesse?

60
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,633
<i>Yeah. What's up?</i>

61
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,703
Jesse, w-where are you?

62
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:27,770
<i>With Mike.</i>

63
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,039
I know you're with Mike.

64
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:31,707
Are-- Are you all right?

65
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:33,109
Does he have a gun on you?

66
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:35,878
No.

67
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:38,514
<i>Well, what's going on, then?</i>

68
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:40,850
We're driving.

69
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:41,884
<i>Driving?</i>

70
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,286
Driving where?

71
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,455
I don't know.

72
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,557
Uh, north.

73
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:54,163
W-W-- Why is he driving you?

74
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:55,264
<i>Where is he going?</i>

75
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:57,000
Beats me.

76
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:58,902
I-- I don't-- I--

77
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:00,170
Put Mike back on.

78
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,242
Hello again.

79
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:08,646
Mike, tell me now
exactly what is going on.

80
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,149
Jesse's with me today,
so what you need to do

81
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:13,818
is to go back to your lab
and get on with the cook.

82
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:16,321
You're gonna have to muddle through
this one without him, okay?

83
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:17,957
<i>That's what's going on.</i>

84
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,391
But it doesn't--

85
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:20,493
<i>Goodbye, Walter.</i>

86
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:21,694
Mike--

87
00:07:46,921 --> 00:07:48,388
Sir--

88
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:50,490
Excuse me. Sir.

89
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:51,958
You're not allowed back there.

90
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:53,026
Excuse me, sir.

91
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:57,230
As I said, sir,
Mr. Fring is not here.

92
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,998
This area's for employees only,

93
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:01,034
and I have to ask
that you leave immediately.

94
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:28,994
What you told Mr. White,
that's...

95
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:33,232
that's just bullshit, right?

96
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:54,988
You, uh, you figure on just
leaving me in some ditch?

97
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,127
What do you care?

98
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:02,395
I don't.

99
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:07,300
But I'll tell you now,
you better shoot straight,

100
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:09,102
old man,

101
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,703
or I'll slice off
your other ear

102
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:12,738
before this is over.

103
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:13,692
Ahem.

104
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:38,910
You coming?

105
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:42,480
We got to do this
six more times today,

106
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:44,615
with a lot of miles in between.

107
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:47,518
I'd like to finish before dark.

108
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:29,613
This freaking guy,
I tell you what.

109
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,715
It's like Scarface had sex

110
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:33,216
with Mister Rogers
or something.

111
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:35,985
Who does this, you know?

112
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,419
Your boy Heisenberg.

113
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:38,754
Thought we had him already.

114
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:40,789
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

115
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:41,824
Yeah, no.

116
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,191
Getz busted him
a few months back.

117
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:45,394
Yeah, well, no offense

118
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:47,096
to Detective
Doogie Howser there,

119
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,033
but all he caught
was a dipshit lifer

120
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:52,936
by the name
of Jimmy In-N-Out.

121
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,772
This one--
He's your Heisenberg?

122
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:58,075
Yeah, I believe he is.

123
00:13:58,109 --> 00:13:59,476
So what are you thinking?

124
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,512
Rival drug gang
taking out the mastermind?

125
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:04,781
Any names I should check out?

126
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:06,349
I wish I could help you there.

127
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:08,818
Only two people I know
connected with the blue stuff.

128
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:12,822
Uh, one is a beanie-wearing
jizz stain

129
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,558
by the name
of Brandon Mayhew--

130
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:16,193
Street name, uh, Badger.

131
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:18,962
Definitely another player.

132
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:23,833
The other one
is, uh, Jesse Pinkman.

133
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:26,870
He and I have a history.

134
00:14:26,904 --> 00:14:29,506
Yeah.

135
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,709
You see Pinkman as a shooter?

136
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,478
That would surprise me.

137
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:36,813
Well, we got a composite

138
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,781
of a person of interest.

139
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:41,617
It's a guy the neighbors saw

140
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:44,687
at Boetticher's place
right after the shooting.

141
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:49,226
Eh...sorry.

142
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,928
No, hang on to it,
just in case.

143
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:53,431
Then we got a couple of
prints we're hoping to I.D.

144
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:54,899
If I get any kind of hit,

145
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,701
I'll keep you
in the loop on that.

146
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:59,738
You know, uh, Tim,

147
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:02,608
look, I appreciate
what you're doing, really--

148
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:04,509
Uh, you know, keeping me
involved and all,

149
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:07,178
but, uh, you know,

150
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:12,516
finding this guy Heisenberg
dead like this...

151
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,486
I have to say, it, uh...

152
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,388
kind of feels like closure
to me, you know?

153
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:22,459
Hank, you really are
a big help here.

154
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:24,261
No, I know.
I get it, really.

155
00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:26,530
But I'm done.

156
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,589
Oh, no.

157
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:32,897
You don't need to do that.

158
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,734
This is why I'm out here,
right?

159
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,802
To be, like, your backup?

160
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:41,605
Uh-huh.

161
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,309
So if I'm out here
in a guard-type capacity

162
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:46,444
to watch over the money,

163
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:49,914
that means I need, like,
a gun, right?

164
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:51,016
Nope.

165
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,302
I mean, isn't that,
like, completely idiotic

166
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:10,904
for me to be out here
without a gun?

167
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,706
I mean, you haven't said dick

168
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,074
about what I'm supposed
to be doing here,

169
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:15,676
and I'm supposed
to do it without a gun?

170
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,312
How does that even make sense?

171
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:21,548
What?

172
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,149
I can smoke, right?

173
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:25,585
Not a chance.

174
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:09,396
Uhh...

175
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,436
Buh-buh-buh-buh-
buh-buh-buh-buh.

176
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,588
♪ Fallacies ♪

177
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:34,224
♪ Fallacies ♪

178
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:36,893

179
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:50,273
Uhh.

180
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:54,410
It's finally hitting me
what the-- The plan is here.

181
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:57,046
It's to bore me to death, so...

182
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:01,617
mission accomplished
because it's totally working.

183
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:03,919
Great job.

184
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,925
You know, I really do
get what's going on

185
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,763
with all the dead drops
and bags of cash.

186
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,934
I mean, my boys
had the exact same system

187
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:20,003
when I was running things.

188
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:21,639
My crew.

189
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:25,008
Nowhere near the same cheese
you guys are slinging,

190
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:27,077
but same theory--

191
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:31,181
To maintain separation
between dealer and supplier,

192
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:33,183
reduce risk,

193
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:35,185
et cetera.

194
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:38,355
Look, don't you think
it would be good

195
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,259
if there was some back and
forth communication here?

196
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:43,727
You got me riding shotgun

197
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:45,495
to every dark anal recess
of this state.

198
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,964
Be nice if you
clued me in a little.

199
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:53,536
I mean, I'm here
to do a job, right?

200
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,139
And, I mean, yo,
like, if I'm the guy,

201
00:19:57,173 --> 00:20:00,475
then you should just tell me
what the hell's up.

202
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:06,247
What?

203
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:08,283
You are not the guy.

204
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:10,151
You're not capable
of being the guy.

205
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:11,887
I had a guy, but now I don't.

206
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:14,656
You are not the guy.

207
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,793
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

208
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:20,395
I don't know.
It's not my call.

209
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,663
I just do what I'm told,

210
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:23,599
and now you're gonna
do what you're told,

211
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:26,202
which is to sit here, shut up,

212
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:28,905
and stay in the car
till we finish our pickups.

213
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:30,273
You got it?

214
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:17,381
Oh.

215
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:25,822
We having second thoughts?

216
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:27,457
Every hour of every day.

217
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:29,492
Let me tell you,

218
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:31,194
that is perfectly normal.

219
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:33,562
But your expectations
are realistic.

220
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:35,664
You have a good,
solid business plan.

221
00:22:35,698 --> 00:22:37,699
I'm feeling very confident.

222
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:40,335
You have an excellent shot
at making this work.

223
00:22:43,372 --> 00:22:44,405
Walt.

224
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:47,776
Hmm.

225
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,843
We good?

226
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,847
Yeah.

227
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:58,020
All right.

228
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:11,502
Well, my congratulations
to the both of you.

229
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:13,537
Thank you very much, Alan.

230
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:15,439
It is my pleasure.

231
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,142
Ah.

232
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:20,911
Mr. White.

233
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:22,879
Best of luck.

234
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:23,913
Thank you.

235
00:23:25,282 --> 00:23:27,750
I'm bringing my car over
first thing next week

236
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:28,918
for a wash and wax.

237
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:30,252
Oh, well, we'll
be looking for you.

238
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:32,021
I'll be there.

239
00:23:32,055 --> 00:23:33,022
Thank you again.

240
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:34,023
You're welcome.

241
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:35,057
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

242
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:42,864
Wow. It's official.

243
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:46,568
How are you feeling?

244
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:52,408
I'm...

245
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:54,310
well, I'm--
How do you feel?

246
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:57,814
Uh...nervous.

247
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:00,751
Scared.

248
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:04,454
This is a big step, Walt.

249
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:06,524
If we don't
do this right--

250
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,225
We'll be fine.

251
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,227
We will?

252
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:16,333
Tell me again.

253
00:24:20,171 --> 00:24:24,341
We will be fine.
Believe it.

254
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:28,878
If we're
going to do this--

255
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:30,847
I mean, we're really
going to do this--

256
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:33,949
Then we have to
promise each other

257
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:36,018
no more secrets.

258
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:41,422
There can't be any
mistakes like before.

259
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:44,426
There has to be
complete honesty.

260
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,995
I'm all for that.

261
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:49,331
Good.

262
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,034
Well, then, uh,

263
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:54,970
how about a drink to celebrate?

264
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:56,304
Well--

265
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:58,740
Well, we own a big-ass
car wash now.

266
00:24:58,775 --> 00:25:01,543
We do. I guess
that merits a celebration.

267
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:02,945
Nothing too expensive.

268
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,747
Right. Right.

269
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:06,849
- Non-fancy liquor it is.
- Yes.

270
00:25:06,883 --> 00:25:09,085
Just as long
as it gets the job done.

271
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,120
Oop.

272
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:17,728
<i>Uh, it's me.</i>

273
00:25:17,762 --> 00:25:19,296
<i>I just wanted to say</i>

274
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,165
<i>that I was thinking
about you and the kids,</i>

275
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,034
<i>and, uh...</i>

276
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:26,836
<i>I love you.</i>

277
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:52,194
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

278
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:53,195
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

279
00:25:53,229 --> 00:25:54,229
- Just take it off.
- Okay.

280
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:25,011
The sheets, they smell
different than I remember.

281
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:26,779
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.

282
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:29,583
Oh.

283
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:31,285
New fabric softener.

284
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,920
Mmm.

285
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:34,622
Mm, I like it.

286
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,292
I, uh...

287
00:26:38,326 --> 00:26:41,494
also got a new haircut.

288
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:43,196
Don't know if you--

289
00:26:43,231 --> 00:26:45,699
Oh, yes, I-- I was
going to say something.

290
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:47,501
Were you, really?

291
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:51,972
I do like it.

292
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:55,676
Thanks.

293
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,884
So, um, dinner tomorrow night?

294
00:27:02,918 --> 00:27:07,823
I told Marie that we'd
come over and eat with them.

295
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:11,527
Uh, think maybe you'll be free?

296
00:27:14,597 --> 00:27:15,798
Yeah.

297
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:18,399
Yeah, we can do that.

298
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:20,235
That'll--
That'll be nice.

299
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:23,471
Good.

300
00:27:26,475 --> 00:27:28,242
Marie says
it's about the only thing

301
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:30,578
that'll get Hank
out of his room.

302
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,847
Mom.

303
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:35,683
Ohh.

304
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:45,327
Hey, Mom, Dad.

305
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:46,361
Hi, son.

306
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,500
Where are you?

307
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:53,469
Uh, we're--
We're back here.

308
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:55,037
We'll be out in a minute.

309
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:57,940
Ohh...

310
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:03,311
He knows that you're here.

311
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:06,380
I'm parked in the driveway.

312
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:07,715
Oh. This is going to make

313
00:28:07,749 --> 00:28:10,184
for some very interesting
dinner conversation.

314
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,920
He's definitely going to ask

315
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:16,223
about our living situation now.

316
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:17,491
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

317
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:22,129
Maybe, uh...

318
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:24,965
maybe you should move back in,

319
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:26,333
you know,

320
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:29,604
just so it's, uh, easier
to explain to everyone.

321
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:33,175
You think?

322
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:58,935
I have to get back to work.

323
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:01,838
You know, schedule.

324
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:03,539
Yeah.

325
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,744
Whoa. Ohh--

326
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
Ahh--

327
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,884
Damn it.

328
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,285
Hey!

329
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,087
Hey! This is a two-man job!

330
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,354
I can't do it alone!

331
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,623
I'm done! That's it!
Finished!

332
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,159
Nothing else happens
until I get my partner back.

333
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:49,745
Jesse?

334
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,585
Where's Jesse?

335
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,387
I need him.

336
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,021
You people have me down here

337
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:03,191
trying to complete
a two-man operation by myself!

338
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:04,659
It's unacceptable.

339
00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:07,728
It's dangerous
and counterproductive.

340
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:12,366
Jesse operates
the forklift, not me.

341
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,301
That's just one of the many,

342
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:15,536
many things
he does around the lab

343
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,104
that keeps us on schedule,

344
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:19,574
so I suggest that you
get him back down here

345
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:20,742
as soon as you p--

346
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:23,145
Are you listening to me?

347
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:24,413
Hello!

348
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,996
Where do you want it?

349
00:32:05,225 --> 00:32:08,628
This is it, right?
Last stop?

350
00:32:08,662 --> 00:32:09,996
Last stop?

351
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:12,366
Hey, I've been counting, yo.

352
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,867
No more pickups after--

353
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,484
Fallacies...

354
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,385
fallacies.

355
00:32:59,347 --> 00:33:02,816
Fallacies, fallacies.

356
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:06,887
One for you, two for me.

357
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:10,757
Fallacies, fallacies...

358
00:33:32,546 --> 00:33:33,880
Ohh!

359
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,256
Ohh.

360
00:34:20,697 --> 00:34:24,067
Yeah. I'm gonna need
to be picked up.

361
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:25,402
Now.

362
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:29,373
Garcia's on Central.

363
00:34:29,407 --> 00:34:32,142
Honk once. I'll meet you
in the parking lot.

364
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:39,317
Cancel that.

365
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:50,762
Hey, this dude--

366
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,031
This dude was coming
right at me

367
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:54,933
with a--
With a shotgun.

368
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,701
All right? They, like,
blocked the alley,

369
00:34:56,736 --> 00:34:58,570
and they were going
to rip us off, man.

370
00:34:58,605 --> 00:34:59,838
I didn't have a choice, okay?

371
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:02,608
I had to put it in reverse,
slam into the guy's car,

372
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,611
and just--

373
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,979
I saw.

374
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,916
Ah, Jesus.

375
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:13,452
I just--

376
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,087
I don't know.

377
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,764
Go ahead, kid.

378
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:28,768
Smoke up.

379
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:51,499
Hmm.

380
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:58,706
Mmm.

381
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,817
Good morning.

382
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:13,220
Hey. Good morning, son.

383
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,589
You want me
to pour you some juice?

384
00:36:15,623 --> 00:36:17,858
I'll take coffee.

385
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:21,661
Didn't know you started
drinking coffee.

386
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:26,066
Yeah. I also started tying
my own shoelaces, too,

387
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,901
all by myself.

388
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,903
Go grab a mug.

389
00:36:38,414 --> 00:36:40,349
Milk? Sugar?

390
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:42,851
Just black.

391
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:45,121
Black. I like it.

392
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:49,958
Uh, hey, Dad, I, uh...

393
00:36:49,993 --> 00:36:53,195
I-- I just got to say, um...

394
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:54,796
I-- I just wanted to say

395
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:57,132
that it's really cool
to have you here.

396
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:00,869
Thank you, son.

397
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:02,971
It's cool to be back home.

398
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,574
It just feels--

399
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:10,046
Mom said you're moving
back in, uh, this Tuesday.

400
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,087
She-- She said that?

401
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:18,389
Yeah.

402
00:37:18,424 --> 00:37:21,359
Tuesday, is it? Huh.

403
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:24,395
How about that?

404
00:37:52,557 --> 00:37:53,490
Jesse.

405
00:37:53,525 --> 00:37:55,326
Jesse!

406
00:37:56,395 --> 00:37:57,762
Yo, what's up?

407
00:37:57,796 --> 00:37:59,664
What are you doing?

408
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:01,166
Uh, breaking ice.

409
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,367
I mean, what are you--

410
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,002
What are you doing here?

411
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:05,137
Where's your car?

412
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:07,339
Mike dropped me off.

413
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:20,518
Jesse.

414
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,854
Jesse!

415
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,958
What happened yesterday?
Where were you?

416
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:29,460
I was out with Mike
helping him make pickups.

417
00:38:29,494 --> 00:38:30,761
Picking up what?

418
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:32,730
Cash. Dead drops.

419
00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:36,634
Mike made the pickups,
and I guarded them.

420
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:38,503
You?

421
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:39,871
Guarded Mike?

422
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:42,607
What is this,
some kind of a joke?

423
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:44,675
Hey, you know what?
Two dudes tried to rob us,

424
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,911
and I saved the stash.
I took care of business,

425
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:50,014
just like I'm taking care
of business right now.

426
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:51,482
You want to stand there
dicking around,

427
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:54,152
or you want to suit up
and get to work?

428
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:56,789
Get in gear, yo,
if you want to do this

429
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:58,724
because I'm meeting up
with Mike this afternoon.

430
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:00,826
What, again? Why?

431
00:39:00,861 --> 00:39:03,429
Guess I have two jobs now.

432
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,981
<i>May I take your order?</i>

433
00:39:31,457 --> 00:39:32,824
Any injuries?

434
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:35,994
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

435
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:39,665
It all went like you
thought it would,

436
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,968
more or less.

437
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:43,937
I will, of course,
reimburse you

438
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:45,705
to the damage to your vehicles.

439
00:39:45,739 --> 00:39:46,773
Hmm.

440
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:50,042
Questions?

441
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:53,612
Uh-huh.
More than a few, yeah.

442
00:39:53,646 --> 00:39:55,647
But I know better than to ask.

443
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,053
Anyway, it was like you wanted.

444
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:03,888
The kid's a hero.

445
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:23,044
Poo-poo-poo-poo-poo--

446
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:24,712
Just the idea
of owning a car wash

447
00:40:24,746 --> 00:40:26,380
seems daunting,
but I had to warn myself--

448
00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:27,882
Who is just the most beautiful
little girl in the world?

449
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:29,016
I think it's you.

450
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,951
So coming into
a business like this

451
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:33,053
that's up and running,
fully operational,

452
00:40:33,088 --> 00:40:35,323
puts us way ahead of the game.

453
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:36,791
You know, we're
still going to have

454
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,058
some change over time--

455
00:40:38,093 --> 00:40:39,527
I think it's you.
Yeah, I do.

456
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:41,095
But we do have
a staff in place,

457
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:44,064
so, you know, luckily,
we'll be able to hold on

458
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,766
to most of Bogdan's employees.

459
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:49,703
We might lose a few to the Ultra
Wash across town, though.

460
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,371
They're making a grab, I hear.

461
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:52,840
You going to put
the kid to work?

462
00:40:52,874 --> 00:40:54,174
I got school.

463
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:55,309
I'm not talking about you.

464
00:40:55,343 --> 00:40:56,577
I'm talking about
your baby sister.

465
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:58,045
I wouldn't let you near my car.

466
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,881
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
you guys.

467
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:03,550
You should put Holly
on the sign.

468
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:05,618
Like a mascot?

469
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:07,620
Like the Gerber baby.

470
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:09,555
I would get my car
washed there every day

471
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:10,823
if I saw her face out front.

472
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:11,957
What about me?

473
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,658
The goal is to bring
customers in,

474
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:15,126
not scare them away, so--

475
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,665
Walt, there's another
bottle in the kitchen.

476
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:21,732
Just help yourself.

477
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:23,034
Ah. Good.

478
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:27,239
Uh, maybe we could
roll uncle Hank

479
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:28,407
through the car wash.

480
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:29,675
He could be the first customer.

481
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:33,345
The wipe-down crew
would clean you up good.

482
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:35,648
See this, son?

483
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:37,116
I got your wipe-down
right here, pal.

484
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:39,552
Hank, can you just
maybe get through one meal

485
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:41,821
without you saying
something disgusting?

486
00:41:41,856 --> 00:41:44,291
So what are you going
to do with Holly all day?

487
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:45,692
You can't take her to work

488
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:49,395
with all those chemicals
and migrants hanging around.

489
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:50,396
Marie--

490
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,965
What? That can't be safe.

491
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,366
Fortunately, there is,

492
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,034
just five minutes away
from the car wash,

493
00:41:56,068 --> 00:41:59,237
there is the top child care
center in the city.

494
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:01,639
The National Child Care
Association

495
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:04,409
gives it really high ratings,
so that's quite a relief,

496
00:42:04,443 --> 00:42:07,713
and, you know, it's just
a walk away if we need it.

497
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:08,981
I got to tell you,

498
00:42:09,015 --> 00:42:11,984
I'm just-- I'm really,
really impressed.

499
00:42:12,018 --> 00:42:14,887
I mean,
you came together on this,

500
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:17,190
and I'm really happy
that it's working out for you.

501
00:42:17,225 --> 00:42:18,191
Thanks.

502
00:42:18,226 --> 00:42:19,259
It was a little scary,

503
00:42:19,294 --> 00:42:21,261
but it, uh, needed to be done.

504
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:24,231
And, uh, we get possession
of the keys tomorrow.

505
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:25,666
Oh, that's awesome.

506
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,733
Yeah.

507
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:28,201
I can't wait to see

508
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:30,069
what kind of car
I'll get for my birthday,

509
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:32,105
now with all this money
rolling in.

510
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:33,973
I think you've been
spending too much time

511
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:35,241
around your uncle Hank.

512
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:37,042
The squeaky
wheel gets the grease.

513
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:38,310
Right, uncle Hank?

514
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:39,978
Squeaky and greasy.
That's you, my friend.

515
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:43,815
Hey, uh, Nick the Greek,

516
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,484
you going to share
that bottle or what?

517
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:47,253
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.

518
00:42:47,287 --> 00:42:48,587
Who's Nick the Greek?

519
00:42:48,622 --> 00:42:50,823
Nick the Greek. He was
a famous big-time card player.

520
00:42:50,858 --> 00:42:52,325
Hank, that's not funny.

521
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,660
What? It's a compliment.

522
00:42:53,694 --> 00:42:55,128
Well, that's even worse, then.

523
00:42:55,162 --> 00:42:58,599
You're giving positive
reinforcement to behavior

524
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:02,136
that Walt is working
very, very hard to change.

525
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:03,738
Right, Skyler?

526
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:05,440
Yeah.

527
00:43:05,474 --> 00:43:07,008
I don't see how it's bad, Dad,

528
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,244
just raking in
the beaucoup bucks now.

529
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:10,513
You know, I just, uh, think

530
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:12,515
maybe we could
change the subject?

531
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:15,619
Yeah. Sure. You know.

532
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:17,588
Absolutely.

533
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:20,725
Hey, uncle Hank, what about
that case you were looking at

534
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:23,361
with that crazy singing guy?

535
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:25,763
Ah, I'm off that.

536
00:43:25,798 --> 00:43:28,332
I-- I gave my assessment
to the APD, and I'm done.

537
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:31,268
The case of the crazy
singing guy. Hmm.

538
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:33,471
Sounds like an Encyclopedia
Brown story, doesn't it?

539
00:43:33,505 --> 00:43:36,774
Crazy is-- Is-- Is, uh,
is the wrong word.

540
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,609
This guy Gale Boetticher,

541
00:43:38,644 --> 00:43:40,645
he was, uh, he was eccentric.

542
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:43,147
I mean, a real character,
you know?

543
00:43:43,181 --> 00:43:46,283
He's, uh, he's dead now,
you know.

544
00:43:46,317 --> 00:43:47,952
Huh. Who was he?

545
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:49,787
He was a meth cook.

546
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:52,056
Uh, he was a meth chef.

547
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,692
I mean,
we're talking five stars--

548
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:57,628
Candles and white tablecloths.

549
00:43:57,663 --> 00:43:59,530
Hey, I can't believe
these words

550
00:43:59,564 --> 00:44:00,731
are gonna come out of my mouth,

551
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:05,736
but he was a genius,
plain and simple.

552
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,940
I mean, uh, boy, if you
applied that big brain of his

553
00:44:09,974 --> 00:44:11,475
to something good,
I don't know,

554
00:44:11,509 --> 00:44:13,377
who knows what could have
helped humanity

555
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:14,645
or something like that,
you know?

556
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:17,014
I mean, how many actual
geniuses are there

557
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:18,515
in the world, right?

558
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,185
If he'd kind of taken his life
in a different direction,

559
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:22,920
who knows?

560
00:44:22,954 --> 00:44:27,090
Hank, not to tell you
your business,

561
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:30,560
but I'm not sure I agree.

562
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:31,795
What do you mean?

563
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:32,829
Well, I mean,

564
00:44:32,864 --> 00:44:34,130
you showed me that notebook

565
00:44:34,165 --> 00:44:36,099
and from what
I saw--

566
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:38,702
And this is just
my humble opinion--

567
00:44:38,736 --> 00:44:42,371
From what I saw
on those papers...

568
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:44,106
genius?

569
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:47,710
Not so much.

570
00:44:47,744 --> 00:44:50,246
I mean, there was no reasoning,

571
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:52,048
no deductions in those pages.

572
00:44:52,082 --> 00:44:55,317
To my eye, all this brilliance

573
00:44:55,352 --> 00:44:57,319
looks like nothing more

574
00:44:57,353 --> 00:45:01,724
than just simple
rote copying--

575
00:45:01,758 --> 00:45:04,860
Probably of
someone else's work.

576
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,966
Believe me, I've been around
enough students to know.

577
00:45:13,104 --> 00:45:17,708
Ah, this genius of yours...

578
00:45:17,742 --> 00:45:21,279
maybe he's still out there.

579
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:34,658
Hank.

580
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:35,893
Hey, babe.

581
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:39,130
Uh, Tim stopped by.

582
00:45:39,165 --> 00:45:41,099
He brought over some file boxes

583
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:42,500
on that case.

584
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:44,536
Thought I'd take another peek.

585
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,937
That's great.

586
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,941
Sorry about the mess.

587
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:50,643
No, no, no. Don't be.

588
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:54,380
You want me
to make some coffee?

589
00:45:54,414 --> 00:45:55,948
Yeah.

590
00:45:55,982 --> 00:45:58,284
Yeah, that would be good.

591
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:28,881
Hmm.

592
00:46:29,883 --> 00:46:31,184
You find something?

593
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:37,324
Oh, just this--
This guy I'm looking at.

594
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,861
You know, everything
he-- He-- He buys and eats

595
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:45,465
is organic, fair trade, vegan.

596
00:46:49,837 --> 00:46:52,505
Since when do vegans
eat fried chicken?

597
