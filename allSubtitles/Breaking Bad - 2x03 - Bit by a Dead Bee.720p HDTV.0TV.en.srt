1
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:00,720
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

2
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:03,122
You sure this is the way to go?

3
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:19,767
<i>Gracias.</i>

00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,509

6
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:04,928
What does he remember?

7
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:08,392
Not a whole lot.
He came in dehydrated and disoriented

8
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:11,126
but once we gave him fluids
he stabilized pretty quickly.

9
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,023
But, I mean...
he knows where he is?

10
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,297
Yes, absolutely.

11
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,508
It's only the last day
or so that seem to be missing.

12
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,832
Go on in, he's probably awake.

13
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:30,045
My God.

14
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:36,049
I'm so sorry.

15
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:45,198
Come here.

16
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:47,809
You know who I am, right?

17
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:52,746
Yes, son. I know who you are.
Come here, give your old man a hug.

18
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,347
It's so good to see you.

19
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:03,560
How do you feel?

20
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,344
Better.

21
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,221
I feel like myself.

22
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:15,889
Really, I mean, in...

23
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:20,226
The last couple days
are missing, but...

24
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:22,863
other than that, I feel fine.

25
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:24,893
My God, Walt.

26
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,829
What a day this has been?

27
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:31,956
So, Uncle Hank.

28
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,943
He was in a shoot-out.

29
00:05:34,204 --> 00:05:35,499
A shoot-out?

30
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,671
He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

31
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,423
- Uncle Hank wasted him.
- My God. Is he all right?

32
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,234
- Absolutely fine.
- But where did this happen?

33
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,479
- How could he be...
- Walt, everything's okay.

34
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:49,581
We're all okay.

35
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:55,354
<i>And no idea what caused it?</i>

36
00:05:57,098 --> 00:06:00,176
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so...

37
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:03,686
<i>But what could it be?
Did they give you a worst-case scenario?</i>

38
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:05,668
I really...

39
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:11,370
There's no point in getting
ahead of ourselves, so...

40
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:13,291
Which supermarket?

41
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,417
Is it, like, a big one?
Like, a chain?

42
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:19,665
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

43
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,830
I think it's just great that

44
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,023
he's back and he's feeling better.

45
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:26,810
I just, I mean...

46
00:06:28,624 --> 00:06:30,368
He... naked?

47
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:31,945
He was...

48
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:33,566
naked...

49
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,094
naked.

50
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:37,638
In a supermarket.

51
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

52
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:43,335
<i>In any case, I'm gonna get
over there as soon as I can.</i>

53
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,910
Don't worry about
it right now, Marie.

54
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,531
How's Hank?

55
00:06:47,894 --> 00:06:50,485
I ran over here
and I get to see him all

56
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,701
of 30 seconds before
they yanked him away.

57
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:56,848
You'd think...
today of all days,

58
00:06:57,481 --> 00:06:59,813
they'd let him go home on time.

59
00:07:01,436 --> 00:07:02,588
<i>But how is he?</i>

60
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:03,886
Really?

61
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:12,935
He's indestructible, you know that.

62
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,213
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

63
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,856
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca

64
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:25,474
and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

65
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,137
He was shot previous
to your arrival?

66
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:29,428
Yes, sir.

67
00:07:29,553 --> 00:07:32,479
Again I instructed
him to show his hands.

68
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,557
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle

69
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:39,083
and fired on me with what I ascertained
to be an M16 assault rifle.

70
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:43,584
I returned fire and sought cover
as Mr. Salamanca proceed to engage me.

71
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,316
When he paused to reload...

72
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,178
I was able to take
an effective shot.

73
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,681
Agent Schrader,

74
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:58,477
what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

75
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:01,753
Mr. Salamanca's presence was
not something I'd anticipated.

76
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:04,316
- I was tending to another matter.
- What other matter?

77
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:10,531
An unrelated family matter.

78
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:13,784
Searching for your brother-in-law
as I understand.

79
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,961
- Your brother-in-law?
- Yes, sir.

80
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:20,824
He's since been found. He's fine.
The whole thing was a misunderstanding.

81
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,382
But at the time,
he'd been missing for several hours and,

82
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:26,605
since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

83
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,632
I was talking to his friends

84
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,677
and acquaintances trying to get a fix
on his whereabouts.

85
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,764
The Monte Carlo at the scene belonged
to a former student of his, a...

86
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:37,538
Jesse Pinkman.

87
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:41,163
I was tracking down
Mr. Pinkman's car

88
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:45,031
- when I came across Mr. Salamanca.
- And what about this Pinkman?

89
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:48,144
What was his car doing at the crime
scene? Have you run him down yet?

90
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,498
Not yet, but we're working on it.

91
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:06,384
Man, they're like Jehovah's witnesses.
They don't give up.

92
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:10,404
I don't get it.
Why don't they just kick your door down?

93
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:13,576
- They need probable cause.
- "Probable cause?"

94
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:16,140
Yo, what'd you do?
Rob a bank?

95
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:19,055
I told you, this is serious shit.

96
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,709
I'm like an outlaw.

97
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,697
Let's do this.

98
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:47,861
Holy christ!

99
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,006
You're Willy Wonka!

100
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,361
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket!

101
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:57,139
Put me on your magical boat, man!

102
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,096
Sail me down
your chocolatey river of meth!

103
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:01,892
So, where you keep the pseudo?

104
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,545
It's a P2P cook.
That barrel?

105
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,008
Aqueous methylamine.
With that, you don't need pseudo.

106
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,008
Come on, help me out, man!

107
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,582
No pseudo?

108
00:10:12,356 --> 00:10:14,023
Come to me, beautiful baby.

109
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:16,048
I'm gonna be so good to you.

110
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:20,389
Just take this, here.

111
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:24,416
But I can't just let
you break this down.

112
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,243
- That'd be sacrilege!
- I told you, that's why we're here.

113
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:30,081
- You saw the cops! All right?
- Sure.

114
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:32,571
But couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

115
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,745
- For the road?
- No, forget it, all right?

116
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,261
This stuff has to go, like, now.

117
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,595
You owe me!

118
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:43,558
We're cool and all, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

119
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:45,290
God, Badger!

120
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:49,611
Don't mess with me!

121
00:10:51,086 --> 00:10:52,086
Got it?

122
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,615
I got it.

123
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:17,436
My God.

124
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:24,454
Okay, that's all of it.

125
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:26,967
This is a bad choice.

126
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:33,984
You sure about this guy?

127
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,445
He's totally, totally cool.

128
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:38,249
He's my cousin.

129
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:46,163
- Yo, what'd we say, 500?
- We didn't say, and it's 1,000.

130
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:47,619
$1,000?

131
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:50,744
C'mon, where you towing it,
man, Seattle?

132
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,711
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

133
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,632
Dude, all I got on me is...

134
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,610
$560.

135
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,796
You know what?

136
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:09,207
Clovis!
He'll pay you the rest later.

137
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:12,972
He's totally good for it!
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

138
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,609
That right?
You a "stand-up dude?"

139
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,655
Yeah, I am.

140
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,905
I will get you the other $500.

141
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,486
$500 more.

142
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:24,720
Your word's bond, right?

143
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,661
Right.

144
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:36,885
I saved your skinny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

145
00:12:38,106 --> 00:12:40,456
What are you doing now, exactly?

146
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:42,677
I'm giving you, like, two hours

147
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,390
and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

148
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,141
You're not using your own name.

149
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,554
I mean, obviously.
Look, dude, I'll do,

150
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,733
like, what you said, but...

151
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,524
Why do you gotta go and do this?

152
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,377
They need probable cause.

153
00:12:58,502 --> 00:12:59,986
I'm giving it to them.

154
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,804
What's the last thing you remember?

155
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:19,690
I was driving home.

156
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,034
I think.

157
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,768
Do you remember coming home?

158
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,684
You came in,
and I asked why you were out of breath?

159
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:37,623
You don't remember talking to
me when I was in the bathtub?

160
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,300
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

161
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,267
Nothing else?
No fleeting images?

162
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,098
I don't know.

163
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,744
I was walking

164
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,487
down some road or highway...

165
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,256
with a lot of headlights,

166
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:02,390
and I remember feeling fear.

167
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,708
Thank you.

168
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,654
There's definitely
some good news here.

169
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,351
The MRI shows no metastases.

170
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:16,616
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

171
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:18,841
Yeah, we're looking really good.

172
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:20,456
Thank God.

173
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:24,672
So, what was it, then?

174
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,248
Well, there's no sign
of stroke or seizure.

175
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,035
And considering your condition,
the blood panel looks good.

176
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:32,390
Then what are we talking about?

177
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:33,894
What happened?

178
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,151
As of right now, we really...

179
00:14:37,222 --> 00:14:38,347
can't say.

180
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,214
Forgive me.
Granted, this is not my field,

181
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,330
but isn't it possible
that this had something to do

182
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:47,504
with all the prescriptions
I've been taking?

183
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:49,221
There's the antiemetic,

184
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,005
the antitussive,

185
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,849
the this, the that,

186
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:55,018
not to mention the chemo itself.

187
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:00,295
And being off all of them
for the past few days,

188
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,814
I have to say, I'm feeling...

189
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:04,479
much better.

190
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,956
And when we pick up
these medications,

191
00:15:07,081 --> 00:15:09,621
the information sheets
are as long as your arm.

192
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:13,666
I mean, it's page after page of side
effects and... and warnings.

193
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:16,786
Right, exactly.
Could it be that simple?

194
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,021
We'll take another
look at that, sure.

195
00:15:21,272 --> 00:15:24,172
Walt, I understand that you've
been kind of stressed out lately.

196
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:28,635
- Stressed out? No, I don't think I'm...
- Walt, please.

197
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:31,118
"Stressed out" is putting it...

198
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:32,639
mildly.

199
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:39,104
I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately,

200
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:42,440
but as I've said,
I'm feeling much better.

201
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,652
Shouldn't we be talking about
when I can get out of here?

202
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,530
That may still be
a ways down the road.

203
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,324
"A ways down the road?"

204
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:55,787
Actually, I think our next move is
to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

205
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,348
Now, is that

206
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,209
absolutely necessary?

207
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,795
Nobody likes being in the hospital.
I get that.

208
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,494
But until we know
what caused this incident

209
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:09,088
we can't be certain it won't recur.

210
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:54,761
That your last hit?

211
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,113
Finish it quick.

212
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,540
Get on your stomach now!

213
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:37,859
Get over, roll. Do it now!

214
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,777
I'm going, I'm going.

215
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:50,298
What's going on?
What'd I do?

216
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,949
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

217
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:17,595
- What, man?
- Tell me again.

218
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:19,889
Again?

219
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,055
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and I were partying, that's it.

220
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,474
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

221
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,870
Just bumping uglies and smoking
that crystal you got from your pal Tuco?

222
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:31,445
Taco? I don't know any Taco,

223
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,987
and I damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

224
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,549
- Three days, you must have got hungry.
- Yeah, I guess.

225
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:39,124
You order take-out?

226
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:41,614
Yeah, where from?

227
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,032
You get yourself a little
of that Moo goo gai pan

228
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,507
from that chink place
around the corner?

229
00:18:47,632 --> 00:18:51,184
No, no, we didn't.
We got stuff from the vending machine.

230
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:54,549
You know, Funyuns.
I had a Hot Pocket.

231
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,780
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

232
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:59,540
And you didn't notice
your car was gone?

233
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:02,041
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

234
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,227
Now who's gonna pay for that?

235
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,352
Management's gonna
be on my ass for sure.

236
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,270
- Why didn't you answer your cell phone?
- It was in my car.

237
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,396
- That right?
- Yeah.

238
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,570
We found your car,

239
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:18,907
but your phone wasn't in it.

240
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,617
You found my car?

241
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:23,023
You found my car?

242
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:25,376
Awesome!
DEA all the way!

243
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,315
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...

244
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,724
leave anything else in the car?

245
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:36,299
Like what?

246
00:19:38,284 --> 00:19:39,944
Like what, like,

247
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:42,514
Like this?

248
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:54,108
67,900 and, uh...

249
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,607
20 dollars.

250
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:57,474
That's not mine.

251
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,474
That's not yours?

252
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:02,237
Says it's not his, Gomie.

253
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:05,371
Gee, I really thought
this might be yours.

254
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,621
I wish.

255
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,957
Unclaimed drug money.
Nice.

256
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,395
You know what we got here,
Gomie, don't ya?

257
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,170
That's a new interdiction
van right there.

258
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:17,344
Definitely some new softball jerseys,
'cause we need 'em.

259
00:20:17,469 --> 00:20:19,212
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

260
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:21,511
I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

261
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:25,229
So, who's your chief, li'l injun?

262
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,559
What?

263
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:30,186
- What does that even mean?
- I think your story's bullshit.

264
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,861
I think you know
who Tuco Salamanca was.

265
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:35,160
I think your car was there
'cause you were there.

266
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:37,197
Tuco had a bullet in him
when I got there,

267
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:40,222
and I think you know
something about that, too.

268
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,274
So, what are you saying?

269
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:44,160
I shot someone?

270
00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:46,536
With, like, a gun?

271
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:47,842
You?

272
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:53,628
Only shooting you do
is into a kleenex.

273
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:56,754
But I think you know
the badass who did.

274
00:20:58,254 --> 00:21:00,195
Look, I was partying

275
00:21:00,463 --> 00:21:01,740
with Wendy.

276
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:05,439
Funyuns and boom-boom.

277
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:09,953
I don't think so.

278
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,728
Tell you what, we're gonna,

279
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:17,692
go talk to that skinny,
yeast factory of a girlfriend you got.

280
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,441
And you know what?

281
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:25,174
I got a feeling she's gonna,
you know, roll on you.

282
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:30,810
Don't go nowhere.

283
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:47,033
Where's my root beer?
Come on!

284
00:21:47,158 --> 00:21:49,195
I gotta pee,
and I got low blood sugar.

285
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,220
- I got medical issues.
- Medical issues?

286
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:56,147
Like what kind of medical issues?
You got penis withdrawal?

287
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,720
You got "Schlongus interruptus"?

288
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:01,758
Wendy, listen, talk to me,

289
00:22:02,219 --> 00:22:03,988
and you get a root
beer and a tinkle.

290
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,762
- Now tell me the last three days.
- I told you,

291
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:08,910
we were shacked up since Saturday.

292
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,330
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

293
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:15,294
Not even for a second?

294
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,338
For a second?
I dunno, maybe.

295
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,718
Maybe?

296
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:24,248
Did Jesse leave the room?

297
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,136
He did, didn't he?

298
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:30,723
Wendy, you can do it.
You can do it, Wendy.

299
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:37,981
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

300
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:42,174
It's you. I know you.

301
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,738
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

302
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,657
- What?
- The kid with the crutches.

303
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:50,118
- The football player.
- How about we stay on topic?

304
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:54,345
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at eleven o'clock Saturday night.

305
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,417
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

306
00:22:57,714 --> 00:23:00,175
And that's all
I'm saying about that.

307
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,160
Now, come on.
Where's my root beer?

308
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:09,480
You wanted her to bang
a football player, you pervert?

309
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:11,024
It's a long story, Gomie.

310
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:14,715
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

311
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,937
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

312
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:26,882
And how are you sleeping?

313
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:32,643
Fine. Most nights.

314
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,579
Good.

315
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,046
Have you noticed any
recurring thoughts or images,

316
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:39,806
things you can't
get out of your head?

317
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,413
How about feelings of
guilt or persecution?

318
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:49,093
No, look, Doctor.

319
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,082
I don't mean to be rude,

320
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,825
but where is this going, exactly?

321
00:23:54,677 --> 00:23:57,898
We're starting a process, Walt,
an ongoing process.

322
00:23:58,023 --> 00:23:59,562
Do you prefer Walt or Walter?

323
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,513
Ongoing for how long?

324
00:24:01,948 --> 00:24:03,601
I just met you, it's hard to say.

325
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:06,444
We could be talking
about days, weeks, months.

326
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:11,421
Look, Doctor, I feel fine, really.

327
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:15,662
Now, if this is truly necessary,

328
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,501
can't I continue as an outpatient?

329
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,699
A fugue state is
a very serious event.

330
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:27,706
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

331
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:31,052
What if you were to get into a situation
where you could be shot by the police?

332
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:34,648
You understand, we can't allow you to
leave until we're certain what happened

333
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,500
was a non-recurring event.

334
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,251
Saying you feel fine
doesn't solve this.

335
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:48,158
Would you tell me about
patient confidentiality?

336
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:49,880
It's very straightforward.

337
00:24:50,005 --> 00:24:52,949
Without your permission, I can't
disclose anything you tell me to anyone.

338
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,604
What about my family?

339
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:57,829
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

340
00:24:58,285 --> 00:25:01,145
The only exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

341
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,770
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

342
00:25:06,446 --> 00:25:08,769
And you, as a medical practioner,

343
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:11,409
you abide by these
strictures absolutely.

344
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,839
All right.

345
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:24,605
There was no fugue state.

346
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:28,234
I remember everything.

347
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:34,523
The truth is,

348
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,010
I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

349
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,831
I just had to get out.

350
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,693
And so I left.

351
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:46,836
I didn't think about it.
I just did it.

352
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:49,297
I walked for a long time,

353
00:25:50,004 --> 00:25:53,213
and when I couldn't
walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

354
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:56,731
I got as far as Gallup, and...

355
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:03,687
then it was just time to come home.

356
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,812
So,

357
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:08,275
being found naked in a supermarket,

358
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:11,919
that was your way of
giving credibility to a lie?

359
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:15,781
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

360
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:24,809
Why run away?

361
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,205
What did you feel
you had to run from?

362
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,544
Doctor, my wife is
seven months pregnant

363
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:38,512
with a baby we didn't intend.

364
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:42,689
My 15-year-old son
has cerebral palsy.

365
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:47,625
I am an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

366
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,078
When I can work,
I make $43,700 per year.

367
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:55,769
I have watched all of my
colleagues and friends

368
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:59,645
surpass me in every way imaginable,
and within 18 months,

369
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,299
I will be dead.

370
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:05,799
And you ask why I ran?

371
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,035
Gomie, you wanna do the honors?

372
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,698
- What's that mean?
- That means "yes."

373
00:27:51,823 --> 00:27:53,587
"Yes" is a bell, "no" is no bell.

374
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,826
Come on, this is bullshit!

375
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:59,593
Look at this dude. He doesn't even know
what planet he's living on.

376
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,761
<i>Señor</i>,

377
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:03,597
are we on the planet Mars?

378
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:09,270
Are we on the planet Saturn?

379
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:13,316
Are we on the planet Earth?

380
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:18,349
<i>Señor</i>, is today Friday?

381
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:21,163
Is today Monday?

382
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,701
Is today Tuesday?

383
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:27,038
Seems like he's all there.
Let's go for it.

384
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,641
Was this man at your
house yesterday?

385
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:46,876
Was this man at your
house yesterday?

386
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,651
This guy right here,
he was at your house, right?

387
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,112
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

388
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:06,083
Are you scared of this man?

389
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:09,425
Nah, he's not scared.

390
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:15,476
Come on, granddad.

391
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,583
Don't you want to help us out?

392
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,219
Oh, man.

393
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:46,867
I guess that's a no.

394
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,937
I told you, numbnuts.
This guy's OG.

395
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:54,477
Kept his mouth shut for
17 years in San Quentin.

396
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:57,842
Stroke or no stroke, old school gangbang
Mexicans don't help the Feds.

397
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,883
All right already.
It was worth a try at least.

398
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,922
We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

399
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:04,143
It's all right.
He's nobody anyway.

400
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:06,518
What, you telling me you buy
that lame-ass story of his?

401
00:30:06,643 --> 00:30:09,901
I buy that lame-ass story
more than I buy he had anything to do

402
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,892
with shooting Tuco, man.

403
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,923
Dad? Hey, Dad.

404
00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:18,059
Can you hear me?

405
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:21,731
I'm fine. I'm, uh...

406
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:25,617
What's... She did?

407
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,412
No, I didn't get any messages.

408
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:30,827
You know, actually I lost my phone,

409
00:30:30,952 --> 00:30:33,087
and I've been too busy
to get a new one.

410
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:36,212
I've been busy as sh...
Totally productive.

411
00:30:36,722 --> 00:30:40,083
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

412
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,616
Data entry, like we talked about.

413
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,061
I'm totally amped.

414
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:49,655
Could you give me a ride?

415
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,938
I'm actually, I'm downtown
and my car's in the...

416
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,418
No, that's cool.

417
00:30:58,543 --> 00:31:01,243
I will call you later
when you have some...

418
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,958
I get it. I get it.

419
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,750
Thanks.

420
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,828
So, what are you doing now?

421
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:25,993
Waffle House?

422
00:31:28,498 --> 00:31:29,970
Waffle House is good.

423
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:05,673
Pay phone?

424
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,760
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed. How'd it go?

425
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:13,301
Okay. You?

426
00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:14,974
<i>They sweated me plenty, but...</i>

427
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:17,624
they finally cut me loose.

428
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:20,515
- So you getting out of there?
- Tomorrow.

429
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,356
So, who came for you?

430
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:24,400
The DEA? What did they ask you?

431
00:32:24,815 --> 00:32:28,217
That's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law

432
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:30,064
took my rainy day fund.

433
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:32,033
<i>Your what? What is that?</i>

434
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,411
My rainy day fund, $68,000, okay?

435
00:32:35,844 --> 00:32:37,659
Cueball son of a bitch
laughed in my face.

436
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:39,540
Now I got like $80 to my name.

437
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:42,918
Wait, wait. What does he know?
Does he know it's your money?

438
00:32:43,268 --> 00:32:45,803
No, man, he doesn't know shit, okay?

439
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:47,455
The plan worked.

440
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,927
They bought it.

441
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,468
I got bills due, man.
I'm screwed.

442
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,317
Did he mention my name?

443
00:32:53,442 --> 00:32:55,218
<i>No, thanks for caring.</i>

444
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:00,977
- What about the basement?
- It's clean.

445
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:02,530
<i>And the RV?</i>

446
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:07,109
Badger's cousin took
it to his garage. It's safe.

447
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:09,712
Can he get it running again?

448
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:11,908
<i>Why?</i>

449
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,490
So we can cook.

450
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:16,697
So you still wanna cook?

451
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:17,822
Seriously?

452
00:33:19,953 --> 00:33:21,643
What's changed, Jesse?

453
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,567
737,000...

454
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:35,675
21 pounds...

455
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,455
minus cash on hand...

456
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,369
Cash on hand.

457
00:36:16,614 --> 00:36:18,467
Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?

458
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:20,436
No, I was awake.

459
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,775
Want some cornflakes?

460
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,641
Sure.

461
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:33,554
You okay?

462
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:36,855
Southwest Aniline? Again?

463
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:39,597
What's this?

464
00:38:39,722 --> 00:38:41,860
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homie.

465
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:45,530
Tuco wasn't my homie, anymore
than Charlie Manson was yours.

466
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:48,075
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

467
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
P2P, huh?

468
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:52,570
So what are you thinking?

469
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:55,346
The two stooges over here cooked it?

470
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,579
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

471
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,337
At least since this.

472
00:39:08,008 --> 00:39:10,868
Somehow, some way,
it's all connected.

473
00:39:12,471 --> 00:39:14,540
A simple explanation...

474
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:17,590
only I'm not seeing it.
And it's making my head hurt.

475
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:20,192
That's 'cause you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

476
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,967
It's dead around here.
Let's go get a couple of beers.

477
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:24,486
It's 11 in the morning.

478
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,696
I'm buying.

479
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:30,038
You're buying? Holy crap.
What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?

480
00:39:33,902 --> 00:39:34,902
Surprise!

481
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:39,065
You sneaky bastard, you!

482
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:42,049
Very nice work.

483
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,380
Thank you, sir.

484
00:39:46,455 --> 00:39:47,679
What's this?

485
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:52,903
- Look at that, I love it!
- They got the gut right.

486
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:56,059
Thanks, man. Thank you.

487
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,386
We all got you a little something.

488
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:02,065
This is from all of us.

489
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,946
You shouldn't have.

490
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,837
You sick, sick puppies.

491
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:10,380
I love it!

492
00:40:15,658 --> 00:40:17,581
You going to finish
your apple juice?

493
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:21,321
No thanks, buddy. You take it.

494
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,487
You're supposed to drink it.

495
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:27,540
The nurse said you
have to stay hydrated.

496
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:30,052
But I'm not thirsty.

497
00:40:30,733 --> 00:40:32,928
Dad. Drink it.

498
00:40:46,923 --> 00:40:49,002
Better late than never, huh?

499
00:40:51,932 --> 00:40:55,619
How you doing, buddy? You all right?
I see the Mark of the Beast there, huh?

500
00:40:56,811 --> 00:41:00,736
Marie stopped by this morning.
They really cheer the place up.

501
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,375
I ran into Sky downstairs.

502
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:09,500
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you free-loading bastard!

503
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,022
So tell us about the shoot-out.

504
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,093
You know...
Just doing my job.

505
00:41:16,218 --> 00:41:18,692
Whole thing was over
in about five seconds.

506
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:20,673
Say, Walt, you know,

507
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,414
how are you?

508
00:41:24,502 --> 00:41:25,502
I'm okay.

509
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:27,967
Really, I'm feeling fine.

510
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:33,053
The doctor is calling it a...

511
00:41:34,098 --> 00:41:37,957
an "isolated episode of
transient global amnesia."

512
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,246
Damn.

513
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:41,935
Which means non-recurring.

514
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,339
"Non-recurring." That sounds good.

515
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:45,952
Sounds real good.

516
00:41:46,077 --> 00:41:49,810
I'll tell you what, I'm glad your back.
You really gave us a scare.

517
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:51,965
Listen, Hank.

518
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:57,526
I don't know what to say.
You going out there looking for me

519
00:41:57,651 --> 00:42:00,258
put you in danger, and I'm so...

520
00:42:01,507 --> 00:42:05,105
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut it. Not nearly.

521
00:42:06,097 --> 00:42:09,373
Is that what you're worried about?
Forget it. At the office,

522
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:11,940
they're treating me like
I'm Elliot Ness, okay?

523
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:14,461
They threw me a party,
the gals baked me

524
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:17,262
a chocolate-chip cake like
you wouldn't believe, okay?

525
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,205
You oughtta disappear more often.

526
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:22,948
Just kidding. Don't do that.

527
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:27,210
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

528
00:42:28,192 --> 00:42:29,362
What is it?

529
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:34,009
That, gentlemen,
is the grill of the guy I shot.

530
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:36,097
His grill?

531
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:39,508
Yeah, it kind of goes over
the front teeth like that, you know?

532
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:41,996
Sort of a fashion
statement, I guess.

533
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:44,984
Certain folks are attracted
to shiny things.

534
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:46,521
Wow, cool.

535
00:43:13,944 --> 00:43:16,551
I can't tell you how
good it feels to be home.

536
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:25,685
I'll get these in the wash.

537
00:44:04,096 --> 00:44:05,280
Say, honey,

538
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,429
I was just thinking about
going out to 7-11.

539
00:44:09,668 --> 00:44:11,371
Do you need anything?

540
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:18,822
Big Gulp?

541
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,520
Slim Jim?

542
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:34,599
Skyler, listen to me.

543
00:44:38,024 --> 00:44:42,012
This will not happen again, okay?
I won't let it.

544
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:45,282
I'm still here. I'm me.

545
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:48,874
And we're gonna be okay.

546
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:01,781
Do you have a second cell phone?

547
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:06,817
A second cell phone?

548
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:11,332
The night you disappeared, you came in
when I was taking a bath, and...

549
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:13,293
you were very upset.

550
00:45:14,397 --> 00:45:17,218
It was like something
terrible had happened.

551
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:19,667
And then your cell phone rang.

552
00:45:20,531 --> 00:45:23,806
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up and...

553
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:26,222
just... disappeared.

554
00:45:29,842 --> 00:45:32,253
And when Hank checked
your phone records,

555
00:45:32,378 --> 00:45:34,257
there was no call.

556
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:38,466
No call on the phone I know about.

557
00:45:43,987 --> 00:45:44,987
That is...

558
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
odd.

559
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:50,681
I don't remember any of that.

560
00:45:51,036 --> 00:45:52,999
But one thing I am sure of is

561
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,835
that I don't have
a second cell phone.

9999
