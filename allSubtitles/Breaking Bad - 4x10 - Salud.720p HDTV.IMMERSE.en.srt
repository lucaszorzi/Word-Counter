I think your first

is breakfast or lunch.

Um, pancakes?

35
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,223

Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

44
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:24,358
It's-- It's great.

45
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,028
You know, I really did
a lot of research,

46
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:29,597
and, I don't know,

47
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,165
this car just really
stood out to me.

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,668

of great features--

49

power everything, solid engine,

50
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:36,971
It's really roomy,

51
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:39,940
so you can carpool
with all your friends,

52
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:41,575
and of course it is safe

53
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,310
because I am still your mother.

54
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:45,512
Oh, and it has a CD player,

55
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:47,414
so you can listen to some tunes
while you're cruising around,

56
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,716

Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

71
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:28,924
Yeah. Hi.

72
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,292

I don't really understand

00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:37,266
Is it something to do
with my creditors?

76
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,268
Creditors? No.

77
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:41,970
I'll cut right to the chase.

I have some bad news.

00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,042
Uh...

80
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:47,510
nothing but, lately.

81
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,912
Your great-aunt Birgit
passed away.

82
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:52,081
I'm sorry, who?

83
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:53,815
Uh...

84
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,017
Apparently, she passed away

85
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:57,252
in Diekirch, Luxembourg,

86
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:59,821
and this was, wow,
eight years ago.

87
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:01,589
I just assumed
you two were close,

88
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:02,790
given that--

89
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:06,560
Well, maybe this is good news.

90
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:07,628
[chuckles]

91
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:09,697
Birgit left behind
a sizable estate,

92
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:13,133
of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

93
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:16,670
- What? - Yeah, well, seems she had
no immediate relatives,

94
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:18,605
so the estate's
just been sitting

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,973
while the folks over in the EU

96
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,175
searched for a living heir.

97
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:28,082
I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg,

98
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:30,118
definitely no one who
would name me in their will.

99
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:31,353
Huh.

100
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,624
Well...

101
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:37,928
Ah, here you go.

102
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,463
She left no will,

103
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,933
so that's probably
why it took so long.

104
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,001
They traced the inheritance
through to your father,

105
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,203

00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:39,038
God, I just would--

182
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:41,874
I would never,
never hear the end of it,

183
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:43,843
so please...

184
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:51,952
can we just keep this
between us?

185
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:53,487
Would you do that for me?

186
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:57,959
Just keep it to yourself.

187
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:01,262
I don't understand.

188
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:03,165
How'd you get into a fight?

189
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,133
And with who?

190
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:13,575
[weeping]

191
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,749
I made a mistake.

192
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,393
And it's my own fault.

193
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,566
I had it coming.

194
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,803
Dad, it's okay.

195
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:47,475
It's all my fault.

196
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:54,850
I just-- I'm sorry.

197
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,023
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:03,159
Dad...

199
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:04,627
come here.

200
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:09,898
Come on.
Dad, it's okay.

201
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:12,900
[sobbing]
Hey-- Hey--

202
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:15,236
It's okay.

203
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,070
Please, it's--
it's okay.

204
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:18,672
Look at me.
Look at me.

205
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:20,841
It's okay.

206
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,010
It is.
Come on.

207
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:24,712
Come on.

208
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,056
It's okay.

209
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:44,333
Hey, how was your birthday?

210
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:48,704
Good.
Get some rest.

211
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:49,905
Okay.

212
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:54,309
The new car?

213
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:58,580
Did you drive it here?

214
00:16:58,614 --> 00:16:59,581
Yeah.

215
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:00,682
Hm.

216
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,518
Hm.

217
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:05,020
[sedated]
That's good.

218
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:07,956
You like it?

219
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,361
Uh, sure.

220
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:14,063
I do.

221
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,100
It drives great.

222
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,804
That's good, Jesse.

223
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:37,437
[beeping]

224
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:39,406
[growls] Yes.

225
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,774
Well done.

226
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:46,480
First of many.

227
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,118
Yeah?

228
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:52,252
What's that mean?

229
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:53,353
You're staying.

230
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:55,188
You belong to the cartel now.

231
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,801
You can't come
to my work like this.

232
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:07,469
You're too recognizable.

233
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,505
Your face is plastered

234
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,675
on every bus bench
within a 5-mile radius.

235
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,644
Celebrities have
to get their cars washed,

236
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:16,712
just like everybody else.

237
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:19,315
Look, I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

238
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:21,316
Okay?
What is it?

239
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:24,953
I went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke,

240
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:29,257
which I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

241
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:33,127
Yes, but it is better
than prison. Correct?

242
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,461
Marginally,

243
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:36,830
which is why I disbursed
the funds as you requested.

244
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:38,332
All right, good.

245
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,835
Yeah, I can't believe
he actually bought it--

246
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:42,470
"Great-aunt Birgit."

247
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:45,107
What?
But you called it.

248
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,610
I guess people see those zeroes
dance before their eyes,

249
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:49,112
it's kind
of like highway hypnosis.

250
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:50,213
All right,
so what's the problem?

251
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,215
Let's just say you and I

252
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:54,317
don't wear the same
rose-colored glasses

253
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,486
where Johnny Fabulous
is concerned,

254
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,087
so I kept an eye
on his bank accounts,

255
00:20:58,121 --> 00:20:59,822
and I pulled his credit report.

256
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:02,958
If you would,
note the time on that.

257
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:10,567
3:54 p.m. yesterday.

258
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:12,536
Three hours
after leaving my office.

259
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,940
He bought a Mercedes SL550.

260
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,343
He's actually leasing it,
but he put 4,500 down.

261
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,078
He's going to pay
1,830 a month--

262
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,546
fully loaded.

263
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,548
I mean, he even got
the heated steering wheel,

264
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,484
but that's upwards of 6,300

265
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,421
that won't be going to the IRS.

266
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,589
I just thought
you might like to know,

267
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:32,926
loath as I am to say
I told you so.

268
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,134
Where is he now?

269
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:08,462
[chuckles]

270
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,680
[sighs]

271
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:39,994
Hey.

272
00:22:40,996 --> 00:22:42,930
[groans]

273
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,399
How you doing?

274
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:49,937
Good.

275
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:59,480
How are you?

276
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:04,753
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

277
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:07,956
I called her last night.

278
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:15,163
I told her I was spending
the night at Louis'.

279
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:17,231
It's cool.

280
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:21,703
So h-h-how are you?

281
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,240
I'm fine, son.

282
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:27,475
I--

283
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,379
I--

284
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:38,585
I took these painkillers

285
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,620
that I had left over
from my surgery,

286
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:43,490
and I made
the brilliant decision

287
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:45,892
to wash them down
with a couple of beers.

288
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:51,397
Not my most sterling moment,
I admit,

289
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:54,800
but I'm fine.

290
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:58,204
I wish I could take back
last night.

291
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:00,406
It was your birthday.
This shouldn't be on your mind.

292
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,074
It's okay.

293
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,242
No, it's not okay.

294
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,844
I'm your father,

295
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,613
and I don't want

296
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:09,082
last night to be--

297
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:14,054
I mean, you really--

298
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:17,257
you can't think of me like...

299
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,094
Like what?

300
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:27,101
I don't understand.

301
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:41,749
My father died when I was 6.

302
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:42,983
You knew that, right?

303
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:44,218
Yeah.

304
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:49,023
He had Huntington's Disease.

305
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:51,926
It's--

306
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,397
destroys portions of the brain,

307
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:58,867
affects muscle control,
leads to dementia.

308
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:01,102
It's just a nasty disease.

309
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:03,305
It's genetic.

310
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:05,473
It terrified my mother
that I might have it,

311
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:08,977
so they ran tests on me
when I was a kid,

312
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:10,745
but I came up clean.

313
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:18,487
My father fell very ill
when I was 4 or 5.

314
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:20,355
He spent a lot of time
in the hospital.

315
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,525
My--

316
00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:26,728
[chuckles]

317
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:29,297
My mother would tell me
so many stories

318
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,766
about my father.

319
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:33,735
She would talk about him
all the time.

320
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:38,072
I knew about his personality,

321
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:40,008
how he treated people.

322
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:42,143
I even knew how he liked
his steaks cooked--

323
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:43,411
medium rare.

324
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:45,279
[both chuckle]
Just like you.

325
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:51,319
I knew things about my father.

326
00:25:51,353 --> 00:25:52,887
I had a lot of information.

327
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:56,690
It's because people
would tell me these things.

328
00:25:56,724 --> 00:26:00,227
They would paint this picture

329
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:03,631
of my father for me,

330
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:05,800
and I always pretended

331
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:08,403
that was who I saw, too,

332
00:26:08,437 --> 00:26:09,804
who I remembered,

333
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,207
but it was a lie.

334
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:19,315
In truth, I only have one real,
actual memory of my father.

335
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,487
It must've been
right before he died.

336
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,222
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him,

337
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:31,292
and I remember
the smell in there,

338
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:32,660
the chemicals.

339
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:35,429
It was as if they use up

340
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:38,032
every single cleaning product
they could find

341
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,667
in a 50-mile radius...

342
00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:44,106
like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

343
00:26:45,842 --> 00:26:47,576
Oh, there was this stench

344
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,111
of Lysol and bleach.

345
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:51,146
You could just feel it
coating your lungs.

346
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:56,719
Anyway, there,
lying on the bed,

347
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:58,221
is my father.

348
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:04,559
He's all--
He's all twisted up.

349
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:13,335
And my mom,
she puts me on her lap.

350
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:14,937
She's sitting
on the bed next to him

351
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:17,839
so I can get
a good look at him...

352
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,543
but really he just scares me...

353
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:27,682
and he's looking right at me...

354
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:33,253
but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

355
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:41,028
And your grandmother

356
00:27:41,062 --> 00:27:42,696
is talking,

357
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,833
trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does,

358
00:27:46,868 --> 00:27:49,936
but the only thing
I could remember

359
00:27:49,971 --> 00:27:52,940
is him breathing.

360
00:27:55,243 --> 00:27:57,411
Oh, th-- this--

361
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:03,182
this rattling sound,

362
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:06,919
like if you were shaking
an empty spray-paint can.

363
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:08,420
Huh?

364
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,560
Like there was nothing in him.

365
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,267
Anyway...

366
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:29,341
that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

367
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:38,183
I don't want you to think of
me the way I was last night.

368
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,821
I don't want that

369
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,789
to be the memory you have of me

370
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,324
when I'm gone.

371
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:51,029
R-Remembering you that way...

372
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,166
wouldn't be so bad.

373
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,839
The bad way to remember you
would be the way--

374
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,310
the way you've been
this whole last year.

375
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,781
At least last night
you were--

376
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,149
you were real.

377
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,751
You know?

378
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:21,925
Bye.

379
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,791
Somewhere you should be?

380
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:00,265
Basically it was
a temporary hiatus,

381
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,466
but you give us two weeks,

382
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:04,636
we will be up and running 100%.

383
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:07,239
All right, you talk to your
people and get back to me. Okay?

384
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,710
Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

385
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:13,111
Okay, you bet.

386
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,513
Say hi to the kids for me.

387
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:16,615
Hey.
Hi.

388
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:18,951
Nice surprise.

389
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,286
What's up?

390
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,789
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things were going.

391
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,324
Well, things are--

392
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:26,260
[chuckles]
...things took a turn.

393
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:27,361
It's kind of crazy.

394
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:28,728
Oh, yeah?

395
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:30,130
I think the universe is trying
to tell me something.

396
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:32,633
I've got some good news,
some very good news,

397
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,236
and getting
the business going again.

398
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:39,639
Wow.
[chuckles]

399
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,975
Yeah, I figure
we haven't been down long,

400
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,744
so we should be able to get
most of our old contracts back.

401
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:45,012
Sit down.

402
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:46,413
Oh, thank you.

403
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:50,050
That's-- gosh, that's--

404
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,952
that's wow.
[laughs]

405
00:30:52,987 --> 00:30:55,221
How is that even possible?

406
00:30:55,255 --> 00:31:01,361
I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

407
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:02,562
Huh.

408
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:04,932
Guess someone's
looking out for me.

409
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:07,234
I guess so.

410
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:10,872
Is that yours outside?

411
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:14,176
Oh, yeah, you know.

412
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,679
Can't be driving a piece of
crap to customer meetings.

413
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:18,180
You've got to present
that successful image.

414
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:19,481
Yeah, right, right.

415
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:23,653
So the IRS stuff--
that's resolved?

416
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,388
Yeah, it's in progress.

417
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:26,756
So you paid them?

418
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,258
Well, not yet, but I will.

419
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:30,994
When?

420
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:34,298
Well, it's not that simple.

421
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:37,067
Um, here's the thing.

422
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:39,302
I never had
proper legal counsel,

423
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:40,770
so I was thinking

424
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:43,640
I should hire someone good

425
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:44,974
who can maybe hammer out
a better deal.

426
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:48,077
There will never be
a better deal, Ted.

427
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:50,645
The deal is you pay
your back taxes,

428
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,847
you pay your penalty,

429
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:53,781
and you don't go to prison.

430
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:55,249
That's a good deal,

431
00:31:55,283 --> 00:31:58,686
so let's keep our priorities
straight here, right?

432
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,924
Well, my priority
is getting my business back

433
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,726
and putting my employees
back on the payroll

434
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,529
so they can pay
their mortgages.

435
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:12,198
Right, but I think
your employees would agree

436
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:15,335
that you need to get your
financial situation in control

437
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,603
before you can help them.

438
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:20,373
Boy, IRS got you on commission?

439
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:22,509
No, I'm just saying that,
though I really do--

440
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:26,113
I understand the temptation
to restart the business,

441
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:27,448
maybe the universe
is telling you

442
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:30,384
that you need
to pay what you owe.

443
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:36,257
Skyler, this is my money...

444
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:41,529
and why are we having
this conversation?

445
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:43,497
You're no longer
a part of my life--

446
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:47,234
a decision you made,
by the way--

447
00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:49,869
so I don't understand why
you're hectoring me about this.

448
00:32:51,906 --> 00:32:53,372
Ted, this affects both of us.

449
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:54,673
No, it doesn't.

450
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:56,141
I'm telling you,
you need to drop this.

451
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:59,044
You need to use that money
to pay your bill

452
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,679
by the end of this month,

453
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:02,515
which you promised the IRS,
in writing,

454
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:03,849
that you would do.

455
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:06,085
It is that simple.

456
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,088
Okay.

457
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,359
Okay, duly noted.

458
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:14,061
What does that mean?

459
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:17,197
Does that mean yes?
Because I really need a yes here, Ted.

460
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:20,000
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means.

461
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:22,836
It means, in the most
respectful way possible,

462
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,104
there's the door,

463
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:26,773
and I'm inviting you to,
you know--

464
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:28,542
and thank you for your concern,

465
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,210

about this.

either we're all going home,
or none of us are.

479
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:06,976
