Good morning, Officer.

00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:33,381
Sir, can you turn the
music down? Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:35,316
All right. [volume lowered]

41
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,317
Down means off.

42
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:40,454
Of course. Okay. [radio off]

43
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:42,722
You know why I pulled
you over this morning?

44
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:45,258
Well, I'm-- I'm pretty
sure I wasn't speeding.

45
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:47,594
I've been using the
cruise control, so I--

46
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:49,128
No, sir. Your windshield.

47
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:53,099
License and registration, please.

48
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,902
Right.

49
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,771
Uh...

50
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:03,942
This-- This was from Wayfarer 515.

51
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,178
Um, my house was in
the debris field.

52
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:08,946
Okay.

53
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,749
Uh, and that's--

54
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,751
that's what shattered
my windshield--

55
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:16,453
some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

56
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,488
I understand.

57
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:24,761
Yoknow of-- of Flight 515,
the plane crash?

58
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:26,696
You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,664
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

60
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:30,966
I was one of the first
responders on the scene that day.

61
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,868
Then what are you doing?

62
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:35,671
Citing you, sir.

63
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:38,206
What? What, you don't believe me?

64
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:40,375
Sir, regardless of how that
windshield was damaged,

65
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,677
this car is unsafe to
drive in this condition.

66
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:44,712
Stay in the car, please.

67
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:50,617
Wait. Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.

68
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:52,719
Sir, I asked you to stay
in the vehicle. No, no, no.

69
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:55,121
I can get out of my own car.
Sir, listen--

70
00:03:55,156 --> 00:03:56,356
No, no, no. You listen to me.

71
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,257
It's time for you to listen to me.

72
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:01,360
Sir, what you need to do is take a
deep breath, calm down This is America.

73
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:04,163
and get back in that car now.
I have rights. Do you understand that?

74
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,665
At least have the common
decency to hear me out.

75
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:08,299
I need you to step back right now.

76
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,134
Did you even hear what I said?
Sir, calm down.

77
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,335
Now you're giving me a ticket?
I told you

78
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,270
that my house was
in the debris field.

79
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:17,372
Do you have the remotest
inkling of what that means?

80
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:20,174
Sir, calm down. Hellfire
rained down on my house

81
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,742
Sir, I need you to step back now.
where my children sleep!

82
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,576
There were body parts in my yard!

83
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,512
Sir, this is your last warning.
You gotta be kidding me!

84
00:04:27,546 --> 00:04:29,314
You got about two
seconds to stand down,

85
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:31,082
or I'm gonna pepper spray you.
You're gonna pepper spray? Perfect!

86
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:34,018
That is just perfect!
Pepper spray the man

87
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,853

under the First Amendment!

something from down El Paso way.

92
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,014
Border Patrol came
across multiple homicides

93
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,616
just this side of the border.

96
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,755
Border Patrol's been
playing hide-and-seek

<i>with these polleros for two years.</i>

98
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:22,325
But this time,
as soon as they made it acro,

99
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,061
someone hit them-- hit them hard.

100
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:27,596
We're talking a driver
and nine illegals.

101
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,097
No sign of the shooters.

102
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:30,999
This truck was carrying
more than just people.

103
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,501
What are we looking at? Weed,
coke, or meth?

104
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:36,536
Nah. Doesn't look like they
were transporting narcotics.

105
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,605
So, why did the Border
Patrol kick this to us?

106
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,673
They didn't. I pulled it.

107
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,842
You ask me,
ths high-end cartel work.

108
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,677
Los Zetas, maybe.

109
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,180
Question is, why do we
have Juarez-style action

110
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,148
on our side of the DMZ?

111
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:52,483
They sending a message
or clearing a path?

112
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:56,587
Or was this about stopping
one particular border-hopper?

113
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,555
Maybe one of those extra-crispies

114
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:00,824
knew something he shouldn't.

115
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,859
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

116
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:05,394

Don't worry. [phone ringing]

Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

140
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:48,249
I just happened to be driving by

141
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:50,017

142
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,853
So, you're selling the place.

143
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:55,088
[chuckles] In this market.

144

Can you believe it?

145
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:01,089
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.

146
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:03,925
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.

147
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,360
We did, all new stucco,
all the master suite,

148
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:09,096
sandblasted,
fumigated the basement...

149
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:13,099
Right on.

150
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,768
Yeah.

151
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:19,304
Fixing up the place totally
increases resale value.

152
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,940

00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:31,348
All redone. New tiles in
the bathrooms and kitchens,

156

D---. That's great, Dad.

159
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:40,522
Think, uh, I can get a tour?

160
00:08:40,556 --> 00:08:43,992
Eh, these guys are
trying to finish up.

161
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,960
Maybe we'd better
stay out of their way.

162
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:52,131
There are pictures on the Web site,
if you wanna take a look.

Cool.

00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,004
You're looking healthy.

165
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:02,740
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.

166
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:07,210
Thanks.

167
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:10,580
You know, I could come by sometime

168
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:13,215
for, uh, dinner or something.

169
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,417
Yeah.

170
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:17,486
Sometime.

171
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:22,590
Okay.

172
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:24,558
Later, Dad.

173
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,237

teacher over at Wynne.

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,677
Found out he's got lung cancer,

177
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,845
and now his wife kicks
the poor b------

178
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,780
out of his own house.

179
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:52,315
I mean, look, guys,

180
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:55,050
if anybody rates a little slack,

181
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:57,552
here's the guy.

182
00:09:59,388 --> 00:10:01,222
[sighs]

183
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:07,160
Hey, Walt, uh,

184
00:10:07,194 --> 00:10:10,429
you remember Officer Cavanaugh?

185
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:20,404
Officer, I'm very sorry
that I lost my tper.

186
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:23,740
There's no excuse for my behavior.

187
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:26,074
It was disrespectful.

188
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:33,248
[muttering]

189
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:54,533
She's divorcing me.

190
00:10:56,836 --> 00:11:01,172
Oh, I don't know what
to tell you, buddy.

191
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:03,507
It is what it is.

192
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:08,745
She doesn't want
me to see the kids.

193
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:15,149
She said that?

194
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:17,585
Yeah.

195
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,788
[engine starts] [seat
belt alarm dinging]

196
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,970
You don't write? You don't call?

197
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:48,140
G--.

198
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,443
It's a disaster.

199
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,579
It is not a disaster.

200
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:57,819
Oh, okay. It's not a disaster,
all right?

201
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:01,455
She's not going to the cops.
She's not gonna tell a living soul.

202
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,457
You wanna know why?

203
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,292
One word:

204
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:07,294
"blowback."

205
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,395
[chuckles] If she blabs,

206
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,732
it'll be a disaster for her.

207
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,867
That DEA brother-in-law?

208
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,468
Whew! Screwed.

209
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,136
You were right under his nose.

210
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,805
He'll be lucky if they let
him bust glue-sniffers

211
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,573
at the hobby shop.

212
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,009
The kids-- Paging Dr. Phil.

213
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:29,412
My daddy's a drug dealer,
and my mommy turned him in.

214
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,380
And the house-- gone.

215
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:33,883
The feds will come and RICO her
and the kids out on the street.

216
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:36,085
Ooh, good luck arguing
with them on that.

217
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,421
No. It's not gonna happen.

218
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:41,089
She's bluffing,

219
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:43,224
and she knows it.

220
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:51,264
Her going to the police

221
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:54,066
is not the point, Saul.

222
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:56,769
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?

223
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:59,304
I've lost my family,

224
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:02,740
everything that I care about.

225
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:05,909
Hey, buddy, [chuckles]

226
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:08,244
uh, it's bad.

227
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,747
All right... It's a calamity,

228
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:14,216
but we live to fight another day.

229
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,352
And after a decent
interval of time,

230
00:13:17,386 --> 00:13:19,153
well, [sighs]

231
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:21,722
there are other fish in the sea.

232
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,692
You've been out of
circulation for a while.

233
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:29,161
I mean, you'll be just
amazed at what's out there.

234
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:31,497
Thailand, the Czech Republic...

235
00:13:31,531 --> 00:13:34,733
I mean, those women are so grateful

236
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,035
to even be here.

237
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,571
In the meantime,

238
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:42,740
idle hands are the
devil's playthings,

239
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:45,342
so, uh, you should
get back on the horse

240
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,777
and do what you do best.

241
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:51,914
First step: talk to our
friend and get cooking.

242
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:02,456
I can't be the bad guy.

243
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,158
What?

244
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:09,529
I can't be the bad guy.

245
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,035
Okay. [chuckling]

246
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,270
Uh...

247
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:21,974
You know, we'll,
uh-- we'll revisit.

248
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:24,743
Just, uh,

249
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:27,379
promise me you won't hang
yourself in the closet.

250
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:29,215
[chuckles]

251
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,868
[sighs]

252
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:59,003
[bell ringing]

253
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,940
Pop-pop!

254
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:05,743
Pop-pop, the ice-cream man!

255
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:08,412
Ohh...

256
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:13,814
Huh? [chuckles]

257
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:16,249
Don't tell your mom. Okay.

258
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,984
[phone ringing]

259
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,692
<i>Yeah. [Saul] It's me.</i>

260
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:29,094
<i>We may have a wife problem.</i>

261
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,730
<i>Uh-huh. Look, I need eyes on it.</i>

262
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:35,465
You got an address?

263
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:56,694
Hey, dinner's gonna be late.

264
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:58,695
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie
are bringing takeout.

265
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,131
But, uh,

266
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:05,035
if you're hungry,
I could rustle something up.

267
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,271
<i>* [continues]</i>

268
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:21,315
Okay.

269
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:31,460
[chopsticks clicking]

270
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:35,364
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup,
will you?

271
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:47,376
What?

272
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,379
I've had enough trans
fat for one lifetime.

273
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:53,081
A two-day drive from the nearest ocean,
and you're eating raw fish.

274
00:16:53,116 --> 00:16:54,616
That's all I'm saying.

275
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,184
Mmm.

276
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:59,086
Been a while since that minnow
been swimming. Right, buddy?

277
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,155
[laughing]

278
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,458
You know, um, Flynn, uh, here

279
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,460
is looking for a
part-time job, so...

280
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,262
I don't know. If you know of anything,
you might wanna--

281
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,464
My-- My name's Walter Jr.

282
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,932
Like-- Like--

283
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:17,635
What, you-- you can't
even say his name?

284
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,971
Um, if you've changed your
mind about being called Flynn,

285
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:23,173
all you need to do is just tell me

286
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,408
that you don't want to be
called Flynn. You know what?

287
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,574
Dad didn't even show
up till fourth period,

288
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:30,938
and his eyes were all red like
he'd been crying or something.

289
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:33,902
But you-- you don't even care.

290
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:37,467
And now, he won't
even drive me home.

291
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,402
He won't say why,

292
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:42,105
but I know it's because
you told him not to.

293
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,441
Honey, I-- What?

294
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:47,110
I don't know what your problem is.

295
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:49,177
You may not love him anymore,

296
00:17:49,211 --> 00:17:52,441
but I do.

297
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:54,807
I mean, why you gotta be--

298
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,673
Why-- Why you gotta
be such a-- a b----?

299
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:59,505
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Oh...

300
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:02,539
Hank-- Hank-- Hank--
You don't talk to your mom that way.

301
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:05,408
It's-- It's-- It's all right.

302
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:09,545
Hey. Hey. [door slams]

303
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,080
Skyler, I know that you
must have your reasons

304
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:14,248
for...all of this.

305
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:15,983
I...

306
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:20,288
Sky, uh, [clears throat]

307
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:22,890
I-- I know it's
none of my business,

308
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,559
but, uh,

309
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:29,831
keeping Walt from the kids...
[muttering]

310
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,938
You're right, Hank.

311
00:18:38,374 --> 00:18:41,843
It's none of your business.

312
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:48,815
[quietly] Oh, my G--.

313
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,784
After all of that, please tell me

314
00:18:50,818 --> 00:18:52,886
that you are still not curious.

315
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,554
There's nothing to
be curious about.

316
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:56,224
[scoffs] Please.

317
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:58,762
The day I heard there was a
second cell phone, I knew.

318
00:18:58,796 --> 00:19:00,764
Believe me. I've seen
it a hundred times.

319
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:03,733
Okay. All right. So, what?

320
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,503
Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly

321
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:08,037
that you have seen a hundred times?

322
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:09,539
Please, please, enlighten me.

323
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:12,475
Look, a guy like Walt--

324
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,643
a nice guy, decent,
smart, you know?

325
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:18,046
Let's face it-- underachiever,
dead-end life, okay?

326
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:21,349
He gets cancer. Time's running out.
Midlife crisis.

327
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:24,518
He acts up. Steps out.

328
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,286
Then the wife-- she catches him.

329
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,555
I mean, it's a story
as old as time.

330
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:30,656
Look, do the math, Marie.

331
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:33,293
Only comes out one way.

332
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,497
Knowing Walt, he, uh,

333
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:38,800
felt so guilty,
he probably told her himself.

334
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:40,635
Yeah, I-- [mutters]

335
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,837
I don't know. I think...

336
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:45,705
if he cheated on her,
that she would've told me by now.

337
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,108
It just feels like...

338
00:19:49,142 --> 00:19:51,076
something more.

339
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:56,712
[car alarm chirps]

340
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:02,443
Yes, yes, yes. 24-7 coverage.
Need you ask?

341
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:04,142
How much is this gonna run me?

342
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:06,142
[laughs]

343
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:08,310
J----. I'm in the wrong business.

344
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:10,911
Yeah. I'll call you. [phone beeps]

345
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:12,710
Return of the prodigal.

346
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,109
Welcome back to the
land of the living.

347
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:15,477
How you feeling? I'm good.

348
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:18,210
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster.

349
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,942
Am I right? Unencumbered young man

350
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:24,342
with, uh, stacks of cash.

351
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:26,842
Hey, I'm, uh-- I'm jealous.

352
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,608
Hand to G--, I'm jealous.

353
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:32,009
Yeah, speaking of cash,

354
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:34,476
uh, you know what's giving
me heartburn lately?

355
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:37,278
Your former partner. This guy...

356
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:39,046
He works like a b------, right?

357
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,114
Builds a business, single-handed.

358
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:43,849
Finally, the big money shows up,
and what does he do?

359
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,784
He walks out.

360
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:48,886
Talent like that,

361
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,220
and he just flushes
it down the crapper.

362
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:53,756
It's like Michelangelo
won't paint. [laughs]

363
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,257
Look, I know you're
out of it and all,

364
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,758
but you--

365
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:59,826
you wouldn't talk to him,
would you?

366
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:06,233
I mean, help him pull his head out of his
a--?

367
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:09,536
He won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you,

368
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:12,939
all due respect.

369
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:14,941
You want a job?

370
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:17,477
A job?

371
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:19,478
Who's got a job for me?

372
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:21,647
I do.

373
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:33,766
<i>[Woman on TV] Okay,
let's see some jokers.</i>

374
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,635
<i>I used to be an English teacher,</i>

375
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,837
<i>so I'd better take
grammar for 100.</i>

376
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:43,071
<i>[applause]</i>

377
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:54,545
<i>All right. Child stars for 100.</i>

378
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,799
[breathing heavily]

379
00:23:53,952 --> 00:23:55,786
[bell dings]

380
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:07,905
[scribbling]

381
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:17,354
[dings]

382
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,858
[heavy breathing continues]

383
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:40,185
[bell continues dinging]

384
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,007
Hi. Hey.

385
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,842
Thought I'd, uh,

386
00:24:53,877 --> 00:24:55,477
well, visit, if you don't mind.

387
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,546
No, of course not. You don't, uh...

388
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,548
You don't need the room,
do you? No.

389
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,516
I just needed some more
space to spread out.

390
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,551
Just wanted to say hello
to little Holly here.

391
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:06,487
Hey, girl. Hi.

392
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:09,055
Oh, it's okay. It's okay,
it's okay. [fussing]

393
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,890
Oh, yeah.

394
00:25:10,924 --> 00:25:13,292
She is a beauty. Look at her.

395
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:17,395
Hey, thanks for being so
flexible on me coming in.

396
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:20,564
Well, I just wish we
had you back full time.

397
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,666
You do brighten up the place.

398
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:29,004
Listen, believe me, this is, uh...

399
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:30,939
[sighs] I don't
wanna bring this up,

400
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:33,875
but I-- I can't sign off
on these quarterlies.

401
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:36,944
I'm sorry. I just can't.

402
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:41,548
Is that right?

403
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:46,352
If you're gonna do this, Ted,

404
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:48,987
you can't be so glaring about it.

405
00:25:49,989 --> 00:25:50,955
[chuckles]

406
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,190
Glaring.

407
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:56,193
Okay.

408
00:25:56,227 --> 00:25:58,128
That does sound bad.

409
00:25:58,162 --> 00:26:01,163
Uh, show me what's bothering you.

410
00:26:08,137 --> 00:26:09,770
Keller.

411
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:11,805
No.

412
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,972
Again...

413
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:14,173
G--, I'm sorry.

414
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,175
I know how you feel about this.

415
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,410
Revenue with no backup.

416
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,913
Here, here, and here.

417
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,948
I don't even know what to say.

418
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:34,823
Yeah. Um...

419
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:36,325
Yeah, well, uh...

420
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,693
Okay. This is-
This is fixable, right?

421
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:42,962
How about if I just push,
uh, 28,800,

422
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:45,764
um, out of this into next quarter?

423
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:48,966
Would you sign it then?

424
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:53,136
I'm--

425
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:55,372
I'm just saying

426
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:59,776
I can't sign it as
it currently exists.

427
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,011
Fair enough.

428
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:03,946
I'll take care of it.

429
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,881
Thank you for the heads-up.

430
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,816
Well, you won't have to
deal with this again,

431
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,717
I swear.

432
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,320
What if your kids found out?

433
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:19,125
If my kids found out?

434
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,127
This-- what you're doing.

435
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:24,062
I mean, someday,
they're gonna be old enough.

436
00:27:24,097 --> 00:27:26,331
How would you explain it to them?

437
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,968
[chuckles] Well-- Wow.

438
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:33,470
Put me on the spot, why don't you?

439
00:27:35,206 --> 00:27:38,207
I guess maybe I'd, um--

440
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:42,009
I'd say that, uh,
I might have feet of clay that--

441
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:44,244
But that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

442
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:46,812
You know? Trying to provide.

443
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:50,248
And, uh, I'd ask them

444
00:27:50,283 --> 00:27:53,752
to try to take the
time to understand...

445
00:27:53,786 --> 00:27:55,253
[chuckles]

446
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:57,721
You know what? Truth is,

447
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,723
I haven't thought that
far ahead, Skyler.

448
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:03,330
I'm just trying to keep
my head above water, so...

449
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:05,531
I better get back to it.

450
00:28:07,902 --> 00:28:09,903
[door closes]

451
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:12,605
[cell phone buzzing]

452
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,874
[sighs] Oh, G--.

453
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:20,678
Hi, Walt. Listen.

454
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:23,814
I'm-- I can't talk-
I'm at work right now.

455
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:25,315
What?

456
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:28,718
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

457
00:28:28,752 --> 00:28:30,886
No, no, no. Of course.
No. He's not staying.

458
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,787
He understands that.

459
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:34,788
I'll-- I'll bring him
anywhere you want.

460
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:36,856
Dad...

461
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:40,126
Well, yeah, it is rush hour.

462
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,862
I mean, I could fight traffic and
bring him down to Beneke now,

463
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:46,164
but wouldn't it be easier if we...

464
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:48,099
Right. Okay. Good.

465
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:50,401
So we'll meet you at the house.

466
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,269
Okay. Bye.

467
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:55,306
W-Why are you doing this?

468
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,176
She's just trying to
k-keep me from seeing you,

469
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,944
and you're helping her.

470
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:03,614
No. No, son. I mean, your--

471
00:29:03,648 --> 00:29:07,249
your mother-- she has her reasons.

472
00:29:07,284 --> 00:29:09,251
What reasons?

473
00:29:11,587 --> 00:29:14,022
They're, uh...

474
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,424
Well, they're...

475
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:20,462
Well, they're just a little

476
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:22,397
difficult to delineate, but--

477
00:29:22,431 --> 00:29:26,167
I mean, yes, there are
two sides to every story.

478
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:29,369
Always. But, uh,

479
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:31,671
she, uh...

480
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:34,674
Yeah.

481
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,978
This is just how it has to be.

482
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:41,380
For now. Okay?

483
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:44,050
And, look, your home is your home,

484
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,452
and that is where you belong, okay?

485
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:48,287
But it's where you belong.

486
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:51,057
Dad, it-- it's your house.

487
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:52,992
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie--

488
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:54,928
everybody knows that you hen't done

489
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:57,263
anything wrong.

490
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:01,101
Everybody is on your side.

491
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:06,672
Well, it's-- it's--

492
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:09,442
it's not about
taking sides, though.

493
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:13,012
How can-- How can you let
her treat you like this?

494
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:14,513
Now, come on. How-- How--

495
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:16,615
How can you just-- just take it?

496
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,718
Just listen to me,
okay? No matter what,

497
00:30:19,753 --> 00:30:21,220
all of this has nothing to do

498
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:22,889
with how we feel about you, okay?

499
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:26,726
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

500
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:30,730
You and your sister
will come first, always.

501
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:33,400
Hmm?

502
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:35,868
Now, come on.

503
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:38,201
Let's, uh...

504
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,768
Let's try to see this in
a positive light, okay?

505
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:43,201
Both of us.

506
00:30:43,235 --> 00:30:46,134
Let's just buck up.

507
00:30:46,168 --> 00:30:49,899
[sighs] Then I'll take you home.

508
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:55,698
Uh, let me first just

509
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:58,364
hit the old bathroom.

510
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:02,935
* [hums]

511
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,847
[clears throat] Hello.

512
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:19,849
Good afternoon. Nice to meet you.

513
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:21,350
Saul Goodman. Nice to meet you.

514
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:24,619
You're not that lawyer on
late-night television, are you?

515
00:31:24,654 --> 00:31:26,621
Better call Saul! [chuckles]

516
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:28,623
[laughing]

517
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:30,925
I get it all the time.

518
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:33,193
We're here to discuss
the sale of the property

519
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:34,828
at 9809 Margo.

520
00:31:34,862 --> 00:31:38,364
I get it. Flat-fee clients.
Am I right?

521
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,700
Well, folks,
today's your lucky day.

522
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:45,504
I represent a client who
shall remain nameless.

523
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:48,173
However, for our purposes,
you might just as well

524
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,675
visualize a large bag of money.

525
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:54,811
This individual wants to buy
your use today, for cash.

526
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,781
Cash? Cash. I know.
In this economy.

527
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:01,117
In fact, the money is already burning
a hole in my client's account.

528
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:04,553
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown
him all the pertinent financials.

529
00:32:04,587 --> 00:32:07,022
It the only reason
we're sitting here.

530
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:08,957
Fair enough.

531
00:32:08,991 --> 00:32:11,626
We, uh, get a few papers
signed and notarized,

532
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,294
we can take care of this right now.

533
00:32:13,328 --> 00:32:16,330
In fact, I can wire you your
money this very afternoon.

534
00:32:16,364 --> 00:32:20,166
There's just one little
hair in the soup--

535
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,468
uh, the price.

536
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:29,140
We feel 875 is very fair.

537
00:32:29,175 --> 00:32:32,576
But I suppose there's always a little,
uh, wiggle room.

538
00:32:32,611 --> 00:32:37,014
Well, you wiggle us on down to 400,

539
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:38,848
and you got yourselves a deal.

540
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:42,751
400,0? What is that, a joke?

541
00:32:42,785 --> 00:32:45,219
No, that's my offer.

542
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,722
That's less than half price.

543
00:32:47,756 --> 00:32:49,957
We put almost that much
into the renovations alone.

544
00:32:49,991 --> 00:32:52,259
Why don't we just cut the clown act

545
00:32:52,294 --> 00:32:54,861
and you tell us what you're
willing to come up to?

546
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:57,696
400,000. That's my final offer.

547
00:32:57,731 --> 00:32:59,631
Well, this is a waste of time.
Ridiculous.

548
00:32:59,665 --> 00:33:02,599
How could you possibly imagine that
we would entertain this? Come on, hon.

549
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:04,601
I don't know. I just thought
some allowance was in order

550
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:06,836
once I heard about the meth lab.

551
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,871
The one that used to
be in the basement.

552
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:12,273
I looked over your signed
disclosure statements,

553
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:14,041
and I don't see any
mention of a meth lab.

554
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:17,043
No. No. Oh, you got
your termite inspection.

555
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,879
That's good. But no meth lab.

556
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:23,115
Now, some would call that fraud

557
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:25,483
in service of concealing a felony.

558
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:27,685
I, myself, am more open-minded.

559
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:30,754
But it is tricky.

560
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:33,724
<i>Don't get me wrong.
I applaud your c------.</i>

561
00:33:33,758 --> 00:33:36,058
I mean, good try in sneaking

562
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:38,960
a meth-contaminated
property past the buyer.

563
00:33:38,994 --> 00:33:41,729
I mean, you know,
could've been a good deal for you.

564
00:33:41,763 --> 00:33:44,931
Too bad. Now, I uld

565
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:48,434
file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely,

566
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:50,902
or I could start some
criminal proceedings.

567
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:54,037
But I don't think any of
us want that now, do we?

568
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:57,440
How about it,
counselor? Do you concur?

569
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,151

Ta-da.

572
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,324
Here you go, son.

573
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,761
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

574

575
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:33,367
Okay. Ooh.

576
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,212
Here we go.

577
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:43,986
Oh. Hey. [chuckles]

578
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,123
Hello.

579
00:34:46,157 --> 00:34:48,160
Ah.

580
00:34:48,195 --> 00:34:51,233
Uh, mmm. Brought pizza.

581
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:54,440
Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner.

582
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:57,211
Oh, okay. I'll just, uh,
put it in the fridge.

583
00:34:57,246 --> 00:34:59,847
It's even better the next day, huh?

584
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:04,217
Hi, honey.

585
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:05,885
Uh...

586
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:10,823
Sorry.

587
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,024
Yeah.

588
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:15,494
All right. Skyler...

589
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:21,599
Honey, what kind of example
do we want to set here?

590
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:24,267
Right? I mean, can't we
at least just sit down

591
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:26,469
and eat a piece of pizza together?

592
00:35:26,503 --> 00:35:30,339
Just to hash things out
like adults? You know--

593
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:33,209
We have...discussed

594
00:35:33,243 --> 00:35:35,210
everything we ne to discuss.

595
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:37,980
I thought I made myself very clear.

596
00:35:41,618 --> 00:35:43,952
I got dipping sticks.
