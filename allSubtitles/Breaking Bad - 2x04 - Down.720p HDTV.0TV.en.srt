00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,413
Captain America.

4
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:55,100
- What's up, brother?
- Hey, bro.

5
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:12,608
This is stupid.

6
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:15,569
You got a better idea?

7
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:17,390
Okay, fine. Whatever.

8
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:19,524
So when do we, you know?

9
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:21,679
We don't, for now.

10
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,018
No cooking until things settle down.

11
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,347
Settle down?

12
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:28,360
I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

13
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:30,726
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal

14
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,586
that they're just now
starting to accept, okay?

15
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:34,711
I can't...

16
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:37,852
Ah, that's too expensive.

17
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:50,015
Look, I can't leave my house

18
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,571
for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

19
00:02:52,696 --> 00:02:54,782
I need time to mend fences.

20
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,600
So while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

21
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:01,793
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

22
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:15,152
That's $600.

23
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:16,737
What about the rest?

24
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:21,632
- Rest of what?
- Half your money's mine.

25
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:24,076
You know, 50/50 partners.
That's your business motto.

26
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:27,122
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

27
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,498
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

28
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:32,923
If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

29
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:38,878
Just be cool.

30
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,549
We'll talk about this later, okay?

31
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:45,850
As for now, no contact.
Understood?

32
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,224
Where are you going?

33
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,439
I leave first.

34
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:13,174
In the kitchen.

35
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:34,809
I didn't know you were
allowed to touch the stove.

36
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:36,486
Hilarious, Groucho.

37
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,141
Go on, grab a seat.

38
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,778
Juice is on the table.

39
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,242
What?

40
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,662
- Good morning, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

41
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:52,630
Dad's cooking breakfast.

42
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:55,975
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

43
00:04:58,582 --> 00:05:00,457
Nice? Follow me.

44
00:05:00,809 --> 00:05:03,677
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice,

45
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,708
which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

46
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,766
But considering all the polyphenols

47
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:11,331
and the albuminoids, can't hurt.

48
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,147
You didn't have to do this.

49
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,291
I wanted to.

50
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,654
- Grapefruit juice?
- Yes, please. Thanks.

51
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,036
There you go. Honey?

52
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:30,132
I'll stick with orange, thank you.

53
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:33,118
All right. Dig in, dig in.

54
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:35,523
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

55
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:39,933
All right. Got one.
Steely Dan.

56
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:43,248
- No.
- Yes, absolutely.

57
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:46,306
No, in terms of pure musicianship,

58
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:49,284
I would put them up against
any current band you could name.

59
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,825
You wouldn't know any current bands.

60
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,446
- That's besides the point.
- Have a good day, honey.

61
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:56,571
You too.

62
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:00,663
Boz Scaggs.
There's another one.

63
00:06:01,784 --> 00:06:03,141
Whoever they are.

64
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:05,915
Thanks for breakfast.

65
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,428
You're welcome.
Tell Louis to drive carefully, will you?

66
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:09,576
All right.

67
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,242
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

68
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,419
We have failed as parents.

69
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:21,474
Come to think of it,
I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.

70
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:22,599
Stop it.

71
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,055
Give me your plate.
I'll get it. I'll get it.

72
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:30,995
Hey, listen,

73
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:33,733
in the calendar section,

74
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:35,928
all week long,

75
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:41,399
there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

76
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:44,653
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published

77
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,471
and that sort of thing.

78
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:52,520
You know, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might...

79
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:56,415
I mean, I'll go with you
if you like.

80
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,127
And I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

81
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:17,011
You know, you were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

82
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,730
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot,

83
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,412
and I think what you heard

84
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:24,254
was my cell phone alarm going off.

85
00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:30,936
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder to...

86
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,230
well, remind me
to take my medication.

87
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,445
And the weird thing is that

88
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:42,631
the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same

89
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:44,341
as the regular phone ring,

90
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:47,326
which is really a poor design,
if you ask me.

91
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,635
But I think that was probably it.

92
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,566
I tried to go in

93
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:53,450
and change it to a different sound,

94
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:55,725
other than the phone ring, but...

95
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:58,847
they so overcomplicate these things.

96
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:00,474
Anyway,

97
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,039
it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

98
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:08,200
There's got to be a new one
on the market by now.

99
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:10,569
You know, if we do
this thing at UNM,

100
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:12,245
maybe on the way home,

101
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,407
we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

102
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,188
Ready?

103
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:26,190
Yo, for what might help.

104
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:37,096
Not another intervention.

105
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:49,217
Jesse Bruce Pinkman,

106
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,204
pursuant to Section 47-8-13

107
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,592
of the New Mexico
Real Property Code,

108
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:56,470
you are hereby given notice
to vacate

109
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,041
the premises listed as 9809 Margo,

110
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,949
Albuquerque, 87104.

111
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:02,559
Wait. What?

112
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:06,115
- You're kicking me out of my own house?
- It's your aunt Ginny's house.

113
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,899
- She gave it to me.
- She never gavet to you, Jesse.

114
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:12,145
You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

115
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,320
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

116
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:19,338
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it 50/50.

117
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:22,016
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

118
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:24,665
What happened is you're
a speed manufacturer.

119
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:27,257
No, I'm not. What?

120
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,921
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

121
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,134
He came to our front door.

122
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,036
Because I've actually
been helping them,

123
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:44,434
which I could get into a lot
of trouble for telling you,

124
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:46,475
so you're welcome.

125
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:48,526
I saw your basement.

126
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:52,439
I was worried,

127
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:55,153
so I went over there
and I let myself in,

128
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:58,937
and I found your laboratory.

129
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,478
You guys have your own key?

130
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:14,589
Manufacture of a Schedule II
controlled substance

131
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,551
is a second-degree felony.

132
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:20,983
Under federal asset seizure,

133
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:24,225
the government can take
the entire house.

134
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,649
It's not even there anymore.

135
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,486
I cleaned it all out.

136
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:31,235
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life,

137
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,042
but you will not
drag us down with you.

138
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:37,530
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

139
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:41,366
Otherwise, your parents have authorized
me to contact the authorities.

140
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,028
Is that clear?

141
00:11:45,144 --> 00:11:47,289
Do you have any questions for us?

142
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:52,377
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

143
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:55,355
Come on.

144
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,656
I fixed the garage door.

145
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,975
Great.

146
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:54,066
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

147
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,914
- Where were you today?
- Out.

148
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:14,711
Is everything okay?

149
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,791
Everything's fine.

150
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:38,121
For what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings,

151
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:40,177
the cancer support group.

152
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:42,078
I think that's good.

153
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:47,482
Yeah, that's good.

154
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:51,179
You were right
on the money about that.

155
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,664
It's good to, you know...

156
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:56,155
talk about things.

157
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:59,014
I think that's great.

158
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:40,017
You don't answer your phone?

159
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:43,996
No, I've just been...

160
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,464
pretty busy.

161
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:46,689
How'd you...

162
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:50,318
Oh, right, you have that key.

163
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:52,628
Hey, listen.

164
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,293
So I've been thinking
a lot about our...

165
00:14:56,418 --> 00:14:58,700
conversation we had the other day,

166
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:01,345
and I completely get why

167
00:15:01,713 --> 00:15:04,898
Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and...

168
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,905
It's not just your father, Jesse.

169
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,882
I know. I know.

170
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,144
I'm just saying it's a really,

171
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,754
really big wake-up call for me,

172
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:16,894
which is why
I wanted to talk to you.

173
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:21,164
I've been thinking real seriously
about business school, actually,

174
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,900
and you can do the whole thing
from your computer now, and...

175
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:27,031
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, this is good.

176
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:29,425
You know, we're talking,

177
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:31,261
starting a dialogue.

178
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,562
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

179
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:39,921
What the hell, yo?

180
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:43,243
- I thought it was just a wake-up call.
- We are putting it in storage.

181
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:45,761
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

182
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:48,202
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

183
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:51,583
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

184
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,828
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

185
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,541
I earned this!

186
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,830
You did not make
her lunch every day.

187
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,703
What did you do, huh?

188
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:03,656
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

189
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,002
Don't start with me.

190
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:06,127
Now what,

191
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:09,634
you've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

192
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:12,414
Great family, Mom!

193
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,364
Why are you like this?

194
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:16,692
Why?

195
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:28,167
You have two sets of keys

196
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,782
and the padlock to the garage.

197
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,659
Leave them on the kitchen
counter when you leave.

198
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:36,351
No, Mom! Mom!

199
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:39,316
Where am I supposed to go?

200
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,611
I don't know, sweetheart.

201
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:45,551
But please...

202
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,439
turn your life around.

203
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,679
This is gonna help
big time with that.

204
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,804
Bitch!

205
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,392
Jeez.

206
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,789
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

207
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:17,249
That's the way. Don't just sit out there
honking. Come in and say hello.

208
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:20,089
We've got omelets.
You want an omelet?

209
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:21,469
No, I'm good.

210
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:24,528
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chilies.

211
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:26,378
No. Thank you, though.

212
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:28,977
Flynn and me gotta get going.

213
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,175
- Who's Flynn?
- Flynn...

214
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:33,648
He's your...

215
00:17:37,215 --> 00:17:38,215
Flynn?

216
00:17:40,777 --> 00:17:41,777
So?

217
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,689
So? Nothing.

218
00:17:45,963 --> 00:17:47,607
- You ready?
- Like it.

219
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:49,800
Bye, Mr. White.

220
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,839
Flynn?

221
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,313
You know about this Flynn thing?

222
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:11,616
As in what, Errol?

223
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:15,465
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

224
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,465
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

225
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,639
Don't take it personally.

226
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:22,235
He wants his own identity.

227
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:29,865
You think he told Louis about me?

228
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,209
- About the blackout?
- Louis is his friend, Walt,

229
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,790
and your disappearance upset him.

230
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:43,651
I made omelets.

231
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,100
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

232
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:48,952
Where you going?

233
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,564
Can you get the phone, please?

234
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:56,856
Yeah. Absolutely.

235
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:05,277
- White residence.
- <i>Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?</i>

236
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:10,344
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

237
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,380
- But there's a problem.
- <i>I don't care. We agreed.</i>

238
00:19:13,505 --> 00:19:16,529
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

239
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,073
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

240
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:22,846
We're happy.

241
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,036
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

242
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:34,865
Out.

243
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:40,047
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

244
00:19:49,144 --> 00:19:51,002
- What?
- Yo, I get I shouldn't call,

245
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:53,483
but I'm in a situation over here,
and I need my money.

246
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,401
I just gave you $600.

247
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,972
Yeah, and thanks, Daddy Warbucks,
but that was before my housing situation

248
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,737
went completely testicular
on me, okay?

249
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:03,863
<i>You smoked the entire 600,
didn't you.</i>

250
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:04,988
What? No!

251
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,832
<i>Look, Jesse,
your problems are just that...</i>

252
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,201
your problems.

253
00:20:10,414 --> 00:20:12,664
No contact.
Do not call here ever.

254
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:17,048
- When the moment is right, I will call.
- <i>Mr. White, you're not listening!</i>

255
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,300
They're kicking me out of my house!

256
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:32,452
You son of a bitch.

257
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,554
Son of a bitch!

258
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:43,074
Thank you. Thank you so much.

259
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:46,030
Thanks, man! Hey, guy!
You forgot something!

260
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:50,164
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

261
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,916
Forgot something here! Take this!

262
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:35,652
Hold on, buddy.

263
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:38,962
Yo, we should get Twot Hammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

264
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,937
I know. That sounded tight.

265
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,017
Hey, thanks again, P.

266
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,347
I made sure this stock knock
exterminator put me on his speed dial.

267
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:48,966
Two nights tops.

268
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:51,090
You still staying
at your aunt's on Morgo?

269
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:53,978
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

270
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:57,243
Jesse-matic, living the dream.

271
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:01,444
Okay, buddy, listen.

272
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,405
- You're gonna eat your carrots?
- Too hot.

273
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,199
No, buddy. Remember?

274
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:07,882
Come on. Yes.

275
00:22:08,007 --> 00:22:09,381
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

276
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,913
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

277
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:14,844
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

278
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:19,087
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there female-wise.

279
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:23,007
Damn. I'm hating, man.

280
00:22:23,132 --> 00:22:26,004
See, that's why we need to get
the Hammer up and running, you know?

281
00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:29,479
- Get you out of the house.
- How awesome would that be?

282
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:31,255
Come on. Look. What?

283
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,006
I cut all the green parts off
like you...

284
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:36,506
- Just eat them. Please?
- We should do this, you know?

285
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:39,006
Track down Chivo and Anthony
and demo up.

286
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:40,631
Get back in the scene.

287
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:43,236
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

288
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,631
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich,

289
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,241
and then you take...

290
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:50,281
Mommy's home!

291
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,700
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Pinkman?

292
00:22:57,971 --> 00:23:01,975
His house is getting bug bombed,
and I said he could crash a few nights.

293
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:05,508
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

294
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,469
Sure.

295
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,703
I used to not like carrots, too.

296
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:40,126
Hey, Ben,
I think it's someone's nap time.

297
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:41,366
Come on.

298
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:54,223
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

299
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:58,955
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

300
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,115
You got other people to call?

301
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,631
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people.

302
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:08,698
Yo, in-laws?

303
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,756
- Sucks to be you, P.
- Yeah, I know, huh?

304
00:24:14,512 --> 00:24:15,562
Dude, here.

305
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,551
See you, man.

306
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:19,479
It's good to see you.

307
00:24:22,054 --> 00:24:25,171
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and...

308
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:28,299
I already called Badger, all right?
I called everyone.

309
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:30,307
I need a solid here, bro.

310
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,471
Yeah, whatever.

311
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,367
All right. All right.
How about this?

312
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:41,366
What if it's just for tonight?

313
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:00,557
Wait.

314
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:02,554
No, you cannot be serious.

315
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,279
You cannot be serious!

316
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,750
Someone took your bike, man.

317
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:10,409
Not cool.

318
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:23,807
Morning.

319
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:27,407
Morning.

320
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:30,143
Where did Mom go?

321
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,890
Out.

322
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,479
Where's breakfast?

323
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,395
Let's go do something.

324
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,481
Like what?

325
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:56,507
Something fun.

326
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:02,160
All right, ready?
Let's put it in gear.

327
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,117
- Is your foot on the... Okay. Good.
- Yeah. I got it.

328
00:29:09,634 --> 00:29:10,634
Good.

329
00:29:11,022 --> 00:29:13,722
Yes. Nice and smooth.
Good. Just like that.

330
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,201
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

331
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:20,716
Okay, let's slow down here

332
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:23,822
to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn.

333
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:27,416
All right. You might want to...
go easier on the brake.

334
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:30,413
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right. You're doing fine.

335
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:34,230
- Much better than last time, huh?
- Louis has been helping me.

336
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:36,477
Has he?

337
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:38,792
Good. Good. Okay.

338
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:41,870
Don't forget the turn indic... Good.

339
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:44,476
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

340
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:46,851
And let's make that left-hand turn.

341
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,750
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

342
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,850
Right hand.

343
00:29:54,914 --> 00:29:56,773
Good. Good. Okay.

344
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,728
- Are you using both feet?
- Yeah.

345
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:06,163
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

346
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:08,475
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

347
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,600
- Why not?
- Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay?

348
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:16,188
- All right.
- Dad, this is way easier.

349
00:30:16,852 --> 00:30:19,790
Come on, there's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

350
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:22,665
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

351
00:30:23,165 --> 00:30:24,655
- All right.
- Okay?

352
00:30:29,382 --> 00:30:32,663
Okay, just... You don't have to...
Okay. All right. That's fine.

353
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,395
Just... That's okay.

354
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,950
Just try it again.

355
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,125
Here we go.

356
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,163
Let's just...
Just try it again.

357
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:44,192
Go just a little easier.

358
00:30:45,054 --> 00:30:47,347
Good. Great. That was better. See?

359
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:50,609
Right? Better? Right.
The gas, the brake, the gas, the brake.

360
00:30:50,734 --> 00:30:52,099
I can't do this.

361
00:30:52,937 --> 00:30:54,812
My legs don't work that way.

362
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,688
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

363
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:59,651
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.

364
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:00,891
You're all right.

365
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:02,129
We'll get this.

366
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:04,440
I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

367
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:06,433
- All right.
- Here we go.

368
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:13,173
Well, you don't need to... just
take off, but all right, here we go.

369
00:31:13,298 --> 00:31:15,025
Slow it down just a little bit.

370
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:19,154
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

371
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:22,296
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
The brakes, the brakes...

372
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,340
- I'm braking!
- You're using both feet again.

373
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:27,301
- It's not stopping.
- That's the gas. Use the brakes. Brake.

374
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:37,673
That's one way to stop.

375
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:39,823
I told you.

376
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,583
Flynn.

377
00:32:52,544 --> 00:32:53,944
Hands up, asshole!

378
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,098
So help me, I will spread you.

379
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,351
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

380
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:01,338
All right?

381
00:33:01,592 --> 00:33:05,322
Look, this is my RV. You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

382
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:07,397
What the hell you doing here?

383
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:09,256
You smell like shit.

384
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:11,016
It's a long story.

385
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,361
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here.

386
00:33:14,486 --> 00:33:16,055
$750 for the repair.

387
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,085
Make it a grand, counting the toilet,
plus the $500 you already owe me,

388
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,832
and you're good to drive on out
of here to someplace far away,

389
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:23,711
upwind.

390
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:27,934
Here's the thing.

391
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:29,923
I can't pay you today.

392
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,353
But I can pay you this week,
all right?

393
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:34,097
$1,750?

394
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,899
We'll make it $1,750 for, like...

395
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:38,223
interest.

396
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:41,927
- I thought your word was your bond.
- It totally is.

397
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:45,397
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

398
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,080
But I will, soon.

399
00:33:49,393 --> 00:33:51,065
Here's my counter-offer.

400
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:54,667
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

401
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,652
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

402
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:59,449
All right. 2 grand.

403
00:34:01,512 --> 00:34:03,164
Two days, 2 grand.

404
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:05,044
That's totally fair.

405
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,710
Just don't take my cook stuff.

406
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,493
All right?
That's all I got left.

407
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:12,224
Please, all right?
I really...

408
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:14,388
God, I really need

409
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:16,075
a break here.

410
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,600
Clovis, come on.

411
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:45,103
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

412
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,424
There's something called methylamine.
Me... Meth...

413
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:50,996
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

414
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:54,571
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

415
00:35:01,259 --> 00:35:02,850
Holy shit. How much?

416
00:35:53,212 --> 00:35:55,698
Louis took Walt to school.

417
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,364
I was thinking maybe...

418
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:02,427
this would be a good time to talk.

419
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:28,353
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

420
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,472
In Ireland.

421
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:37,315
Weird.

422
00:36:40,056 --> 00:36:41,306
Sounds weird.

423
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:57,099
I wanted to apologize

424
00:36:58,461 --> 00:36:59,711
for everything.

425
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:02,902
My...

426
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:06,568
desire for privacy.
My...

427
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:10,205
emotional...

428
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,570
unavailability.

429
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:17,472
Having cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

430
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:23,352
I haven't been
a good partner to you,

431
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:25,705
and for that...

432
00:37:27,296 --> 00:37:28,639
I'm very sorry.

433
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,675
I love you.

434
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,528
And I love this family.

435
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:39,794
And I just...

436
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:42,632
want to make sure that...

437
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:45,302
we don't lose contact.

438
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:54,809
Thank you.

439
00:38:02,475 --> 00:38:03,475
I agree.

440
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:20,661
Is that it?

441
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,519
God.

442
00:38:23,883 --> 00:38:25,761
God, how long are
you going to do this?

443
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:28,340
- Do what?
- This.

444
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,601
Not talking to me.

445
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,436
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

446
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,096
You are obviously angry
with me about something,

447
00:38:37,221 --> 00:38:38,988
so let's talk about it.

448
00:38:48,254 --> 00:38:49,254
God.

449
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:51,933
I feel like you're upset with me

450
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:54,457
because you think that...

451
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:57,097
I'm... up to something.

452
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:02,881
- Like what?
- I have no idea, Skyler.

453
00:39:03,368 --> 00:39:06,677
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

454
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,976
Is that why you asked me
about the...

455
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:12,349
some other phone? Because
you think that I'm being unfaithful?

456
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:15,793
I don't know.

457
00:39:16,705 --> 00:39:18,271
So ask me.

458
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Why?

459
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:24,899
- Would you even tell me?
- Yes. I would.

460
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:26,759
Of course I would.

461
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,269
And no.

462
00:39:28,806 --> 00:39:31,700
I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

463
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:35,196
Now, what do I
do to prove that to you?

464
00:39:35,683 --> 00:39:39,231
Swear an oath? My right hand to God.
I'm not having an affair.

465
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:40,785
I heard you, Walt.

466
00:39:41,474 --> 00:39:43,374
You're not having an affair.

467
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,539
Congratulations.

468
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,996
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

469
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:49,152
Great job.

470
00:39:49,405 --> 00:39:51,112
What is this?
What do I have to do?

471
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:54,887
- I'm trying to talk to you, and you...
- Okay, so talk, Walt!

472
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:59,760
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

473
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:03,790
You want to know
what you have to do?

474
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:08,006
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

475
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:09,847
Today.

476
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:11,487
No more excuses.

477
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:14,333
No more apologies.
No more of these...

478
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,941
obvious, desperate breakfasts.

479
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,890
You don't want to lose
contact with me, Walt?

480
00:40:23,364 --> 00:40:24,364
Good.

481
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,216
Then tell me.

482
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:29,436
Now.

483
00:40:41,363 --> 00:40:43,148
Tell you what?

484
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,504
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

485
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:08,317
We're not done here.

486
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:12,969
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

487
00:41:35,215 --> 00:41:37,085
Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?

488
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,006
What is wrong with you?

489
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,820
Why are you blue?

490
00:41:41,344 --> 00:41:42,347
Jesus.

491
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:44,284
I'm sorry.
Let's just say it starts...

492
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:47,517
with my parents being greedy
kleptomaniac douche bags.

493
00:41:47,642 --> 00:41:49,920
Are you actually this stupid?

494
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:52,134
No, look.
I know this isn't a optimal...

495
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:56,168
To come to my house and park on
my street, driving this vehicle...

496
00:41:56,293 --> 00:41:58,932
What the hell is wrong with you?
I'm really asking.

497
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,808
- Nothing. I'm sorry. I just...
- What if Skyler had seen you?

498
00:42:03,933 --> 00:42:06,301
What then?
What was the plan then, genius?

499
00:42:06,747 --> 00:42:09,382
- I don't know.
- You know why you don't know?

500
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,611
Because you don't think.
That's why.

501
00:42:11,925 --> 00:42:14,489
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

502
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,735
I said I was sorry.
I just need my half of the money,

503
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,103
and I will go.

504
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:20,783
Your half?

505
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:23,893
There is no your half of the money.

506
00:42:24,018 --> 00:42:26,459
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

507
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:30,084
Why should I be penalized
because of your sloppiness?

508
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:32,279
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

509
00:42:32,404 --> 00:42:35,855
- We agreed, 50/50 partners.
- Partners in what?

510
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,925
What exactly do you do here?
I've been meaning to ask

511
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,019
because I'm the producer, right?

512
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:45,046
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

513
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:47,864
You are a pathetic junkie,

514
00:42:48,117 --> 00:42:50,192
too stupid to understand

515
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,060
and follow simple
rudimentary instructions.

516
00:42:53,274 --> 00:42:54,725
Too stupid to re...

517
00:43:44,139 --> 00:43:45,390
Try not...

518
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,971
to touch anything.

519
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:06,655
Want some breakfast?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
