3
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:51,078
Come on!

4
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:02,553
Please.

5
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:06,065
Come on!

6
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:33,918
God.

7
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:11,038
Slow down.

8
00:04:11,637 --> 00:04:12,781
Slow down.

9
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:16,382
Just... just take a deep breath.

10
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:18,507
Do it.

11
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,916
All right.

12
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:23,838
Now, what happened?

13
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,519
Listen to me.

14
00:04:44,163 --> 00:04:45,563
Are you listening?

15
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:49,952
Everything is going to be okay.
I promise.

16
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:51,891
Now, listen.
Calm down.

17
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:53,233
Just...

18
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:55,673
sit tight.

19
00:04:56,436 --> 00:04:57,886
I know who to call.

20
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:27,073
Saul Goodman sent me.

21
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:38,193
Come on.
Inside.

22
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:47,742
Watch the door.

23
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:52,393
Where is she?

24
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,509
Any other drugs in the house?

25
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,250
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

26
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,974
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

27
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:41,988
Here's your story.

28
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:45,272
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

29
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,308
Say it.

30
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:50,528
Say it, please.

31
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,346
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,048
Say it. I woke up.
I found her. That's all I know.

33
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:02,105
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,082
Again.

35
00:08:04,054 --> 00:08:06,173
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:07,206
Again.

37
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:09,144
- Again.
- I woke up.

38
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:11,121
I found her.
That's all I know.

39
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:14,233
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

40
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,126
Once you call it in,
the people who show up

41
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,832
will be with the Office
of Medical Investigations.

42
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:27,148
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

43
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:29,962
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

44
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:32,138
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

45
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,655
Typically,
Ods are not a high-priority call.

46
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,403
There's nothing here
to incriminate you,

47
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:39,702
so I'd be amazed if you
got placed under arrest.

48
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:42,612
However, if you do,

49
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,921
you say nothing.

50
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:47,860
You tell them you
just want your lawyer.

51
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,835
Then you call Saul Goodman.

52
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,391
And do I need to state the obvious?

53
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:56,959
I was not here.

54
00:09:08,285 --> 00:09:10,065
You put on a long-sleeved shirt

55
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,740
and cover those track
marks on your arm.

56
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:17,397
Count down from 20,

57
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:19,266
and then you dial.

58
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,960
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

59
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:02,999
Do you want 2% or skim?

60
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:05,117
Two.

61
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:36,738
I'll be there in a minute.

62
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:43,454
You all right?

63
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,658
Flynn, get your butt in here.

64
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:56,567
My God. Mom, Dad, come here!
You got to see this!

65
00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:57,808
Seriously.

66
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:02,452
What?

67
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,019
Look right there.

68
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,522
Look at that.

69
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:11,225
- Are those donations?
- Yes.

70
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:13,873
Actual donations for your dad?

71
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:16,399
Total strangers gave us

72
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:19,181
$490.

73
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,016
26 people.

74
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:24,276
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

75
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:27,995
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

76
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,624
And it's all real actual money.

77
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:35,305
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

78
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:39,797
And look what they're saying.

79
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:41,760
"Hang in there, Walt."

80
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:44,155
"Good luck."
"Hang in there."

81
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:47,469
Isn't this awesome?

82
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:50,862
That's...

83
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:53,872
that is something.

84
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:59,844
Don't you think a little
"thank you" is in order?

85
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,529
Yes, absolutely.

86
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,736
Thank you, son. Thank you.
This is a big, big help.

87
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,506
20 more bucks from Thunder Bay,
Ontario.

88
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:14,274
Damn.

89
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,349
$510.

90
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:29,960
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you</i>

91
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:33,935
<i>"Do-Not-Call-List." However,
if you're cool, leave it at the beep.</i>

92
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,285
How did I know you wouldn't
be answering your phone?

93
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,547
I'm on my way.
I'm going to be there momentarily.

94
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,192
I expect you on the porch,
bag packed,

95
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,902
ready to go.
No excuses.

96
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,832
You may not want to
be here for this.

97
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:49,913
I just...

98
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:51,369
woke up,

99
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,145
and I found her.

100
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:56,284
That's all I know.

101
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,029
What's her date of birth?

102
00:14:06,921 --> 00:14:08,921
Your daughter's date of birth.

103
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:10,890
April...

104
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,770
April 4, 1982.

105
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,442
And mother's maiden
name and place of birth.

106
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:23,403
- My mother?
- Your daughter's mother.

107
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,262
Bishop.

108
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,069
And place of birth?

109
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:31,131
Phoenix.

110
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:35,080
Phoenix, Arizona.

111
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,190
This is our address.

112
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:44,713
- Do you have someone who can drive you?
- I can drive.

113
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,052
Then, if you'd like
to meet us there,

114
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,667
we can complete the intake
and take our samples,

115
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:52,342
and then you can make
your arrangements.

116
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:56,930
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

117
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:25,059
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this!

118
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:27,591
- 40 from Te...
- Terre Haute.

119
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:39,799
It's me.

120
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,290
Are you there?

121
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:45,733
I'm just checking in.

122
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:50,593
Our friend says he thinks
everything went well.

123
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:51,963
And that's...

124
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,550
that's good.

125
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:55,568
So... listen.

126
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,554
Just call me, all right?

127
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:02,611
You've got to come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

128
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,124
All right.
I'm coming.

129
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:13,671
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

130
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:16,724
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

131
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,323
Of course, they're also saying they want
to be paid in private islands,

132
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,548
so dig deep.

133
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:23,369
Biggest donation

134
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:26,484
gets a six-pack of
my very own Schraderbrau.

135
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:29,452
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

136
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:31,977
Smallest donation
gets two six-packs.

137
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,999
Other than Gomie here pees sitting down,
here's what we know.

138
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:38,361
Christian Ortega, aka "Combo."

139
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:41,332
Shot dead by an unknown
assailant last month.

140
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,042
"Combo?" I hear you say.

141
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:47,535
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

142
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,078
No. He was a dipshit,
wannabe banger.

143
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,257
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a Baby Jesus

144
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:55,596
from a Knights of Columbus
manger back when he was 17.

145
00:16:55,823 --> 00:16:57,573
This dude was so low-rep,

146
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:59,908
he never showed up on our radar.

147
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:01,811
So why am I talking about him?

148
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:03,767
Anyone?

149
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:05,149
Anyone?

150
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:06,649
Bueller?

151
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:09,562
- He was dealing Blue Sky.
- That's right.

152
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,379
How is it that the purest,
most professional grade

153
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:14,156
of meth we've ever come across

154
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:17,050
is being slung by the likes of that?

155
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:18,783
But wait. It gets better.

156
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:22,271
Since Baby Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck,

157
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:24,390
the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

158
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:27,915
Not a speck to be found in Albuquerque.
Now, why is that?

159
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:32,733
Because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

160
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:36,178
So says APD.
They think they got their man.

161
00:17:36,628 --> 00:17:39,026
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

162
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:41,192
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.

163
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:44,729
APD thinks this is our mastermind.

164
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,504
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you, okay?

165
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:50,011
- He copped to it, didn't he?
- For an extra pudding cup

166
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,559
every night at Los Lunas?

167
00:17:51,684 --> 00:17:53,613
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes,

168
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,634
he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa.

169
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:58,906
I've been thinking.

170
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,941
Top-shelf product like this,

171
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:03,161
it doesn't fall off
the face of the earth.

172
00:18:03,286 --> 00:18:05,626
The way I see it, raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

173
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,662
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

174
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,637
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

175
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:15,455
Haven't had much luck inside
the land of enchantment.

176
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,334
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff

177
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:21,541
making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada.

178
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,734
In fact, everywhere

179
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,270
but here.

180
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:28,064
Almost as if somebody wised up,

181
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,396
stopped shiting where they eat.

182
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:32,839
Now,

183
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:36,413
I say Heisenberg's still out there.

184
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,504
I say he's gone regional.

185
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:42,544
Only he's still right here in town.

186
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,870
Come on, 2,800.

187
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:48,475
Come on, big 28.

188
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,016
You can do it.

189
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:52,191
Only 30 more dollars.
30 more.

190
00:18:54,438 --> 00:18:57,182
$40!
2,810! Yes!

191
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:05,051
- Who's going to be next?
- Your guy found him?

192
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:06,741
Where is he?

193
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:08,706
Okay, listen.

194
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:10,254
I don't care.

195
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:11,888
You have your guy, pick...

196
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:13,976
Just shut...

197
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,150
Saul,
shut up and give me the address.

198
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:22,326
I don't recommend it.

199
00:19:23,826 --> 00:19:25,996
APD's been known
to sit on this place,

200
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,571
keep an eye on the comings
and goings.

201
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:30,705
Are they here now?

202
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,795
Well, I don't see any sign,

203
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,591
but that's the point.

204
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:38,101
Police could be the least of it.

205
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,177
You could just get mugged or shot.

206
00:19:42,706 --> 00:19:44,856
How about you go on home, Walter?

207
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,368
Let me handle this.

208
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:27,141
Look at me, son. Wake up.

209
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:33,124
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

210
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:34,884
Wake up.

211
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:38,754
It's me. It's Walt.

212
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,910
Let's get out of here.

213
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:49,504
- No, I'm good.
- Help me out, now.

214
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:53,681
Listen.

215
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:56,120
You are not good right here.

216
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:58,274
You are not good at all.
You hear?

217
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,533
Put your arms around me.

218
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:04,275
You're going to stand up,

219
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,727
and we're going
to walk out of here, okay?

220
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:09,313
We're going to take you someplace
nice and safe. That's it.

221
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:11,638
Now let's go. Come on. Here we go.

222
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:41,392
I killed her.

223
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:43,347
What?

224
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,702
I killed her.
It was me.

225
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:48,172
I killed her, man.
I killed her.

226
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,501
Look at me.

227
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:52,119
You didn't kill anybody.

228
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:55,015
I loved her.

229
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,271
I loved her more than anything.

230
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:04,738
I haven't given much thought
to the programs, to be honest.

231
00:24:04,863 --> 00:24:06,513
I guess they should be,

232
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:09,529
I don't know. Just...

233
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:11,304
use your best judgment.

234
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,736
There's no yellow dress here.

235
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:18,263
It's all black and gray.

236
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,241
When's the last time you saw
her ever wearing a yellow dress?

237
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:26,521
What about blue?

238
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:29,775
Blue's better than black, right?

239
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,595
Not dark blue.
More like...

240
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:35,375
not...

241
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,227
super-bright, either.

242
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:40,217
I mean, blue is blue.

243
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:43,408
No cleavage.

244
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:46,529
Long sleeves.

245
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:51,157
It's nice.

246
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:54,238
It's nice.

247
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:01,608
Big yawn, Holly.

248
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:05,343
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired, too.

249
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:18,351
There we go.

250
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,519
Would you mind turning
that thing down or off?

251
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:34,905
The dinging.

252
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,481
Just turn down the volume.

253
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:38,859
Dad, it's money.

254
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:42,948
Please do it.
The noise is disturbing...

255
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:44,399
the baby.

256
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:48,577
Marie, slow down. I can't...

257
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:52,956
Oh, my God.
You are kidding me.

258
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,929
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

259
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:01,089
Wait. Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

260
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,177
- Guess what.
- What?

261
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,805
- You are going to be in the newspaper.
- No way.

262
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,978
One of Aunt Marie's patients
works at the <i>Journal</i>.

263
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,329
When she told him about
the Web site and the donations,

264
00:26:13,454 --> 00:26:15,937
he went to his editor,
and they're doing a story about you.

265
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:17,147
For real?

266
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:20,233
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

267
00:26:20,684 --> 00:26:21,584
Awesome.

268
00:26:22,441 --> 00:26:24,411
It'll mean more hits.

269
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:26,186
And more contributions.

270
00:26:31,537 --> 00:26:32,987
East of Scottsdale?

271
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,630
Let me guess. Not talking.

272
00:26:36,956 --> 00:26:38,256
Nope. Not a one.

273
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,507
Someone somewhere's
running one tight ship.

274
00:26:43,938 --> 00:26:46,415
All right, Chief.
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

275
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:47,662
You, too.

276
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:54,108
Agent Schrader,
can you spare a moment?

277
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,783
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

278
00:26:59,294 --> 00:27:01,942
Gentlemen,
this is supervising agent Hank Schrader.

279
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:06,165
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

280
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,358
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

281
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:10,608
Paul Canterna
of Canterna Real Estate.

282
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,585
- It's a pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

283
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,257
And Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

284
00:27:16,382 --> 00:27:17,540
Please, just Gus.

285
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:21,202
Got to tell you,
you guys make some killer chicken.

286
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:22,492
Thank you very much.

287
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:24,576
They are underwriting
this year's fun run,

288
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,755
and I thought I would
give them a tour.

289
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,671
Absolutely. Get to see what you're
supporting. We thank you gentlemen.

290
00:27:29,796 --> 00:27:32,164
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

291
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:36,098
The Albuquerque office covers everything
from drug-related money laundering

292
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:39,073
to interdiction of illicit controlled
substances crossing the border.

293
00:27:39,787 --> 00:27:43,024
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine,

294
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:46,378
which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

295
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:47,453
Terrible.

296
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:50,361
It is indeed.
Now, we've had some successes locally,

297
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:52,897
but overall the supply
seems to be growing.

298
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:56,634
But I got to tell you,
community outreach, like this fun run,

299
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,588
one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

300
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:00,125
Anything we can do.

301
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:03,078
Gentlemen.

302
00:28:05,913 --> 00:28:07,763
Is this one of your agents?

303
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:11,678
That's my brother-in-law.

304
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:14,157
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to...

305
00:28:14,469 --> 00:28:15,639
I'm very sorry.

306
00:28:15,764 --> 00:28:17,392
What sort of health issue?

307
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,742
Lung cancer.

308
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:22,873
That's a rough one.

309
00:28:23,095 --> 00:28:24,733
You don't have to do that.

310
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:25,900
Please.

311
00:28:26,025 --> 00:28:27,475
I'm happy to do it.

312
00:28:30,214 --> 00:28:32,764
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

313
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,270
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

314
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,130
I'm going to have
my surgery on Friday.

315
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,055
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

316
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:05,541
But if not,

317
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:08,743
Saul will take care of things.
He's got your money.

318
00:29:08,868 --> 00:29:10,568
He's keeping it for you.

319
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:26,916
Lingering on things doesn't help,
believe me.

320
00:29:27,237 --> 00:29:29,937
Just try and focus on
getting better, okay?

321
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,791
I deserve this.

322
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,272
What?

323
00:29:37,821 --> 00:29:39,721
What you said in the desert.

324
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:42,030
I get it...

325
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,199
what you meant.

326
00:29:48,624 --> 00:29:50,474
I deserve whatever happens.

327
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:12,384
Shit!

328
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:29,721
There he is!

329
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:34,118
We're doing a feature
on Walter Junior.

330
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:36,543
We called you about 50 times.

331
00:30:36,797 --> 00:30:40,034
I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

332
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,355
I know.
But I thought,

333
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,693
If it's good enough for the <i>Journal</i>,
then why not TV?

334
00:30:45,818 --> 00:30:47,333
So I went for it.

335
00:30:48,845 --> 00:30:50,001
This is him?

336
00:30:50,126 --> 00:30:51,556
This is Dad. Great.

337
00:30:51,756 --> 00:30:55,198
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Junior in the middle,

338
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:57,173
Mom and Dad on either side.

339
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:58,405
Mom and Dad?

340
00:31:00,785 --> 00:31:03,235
How much money have
you raised so far?

341
00:31:03,892 --> 00:31:07,614
$6,360.

342
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:10,397
But there's more
coming in all the time.

343
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:13,976
- That's amazing.
- We don't even know what to say.

344
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,387
It's been incredible.

345
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:19,103
Judging from the things you
and other folks have written about him,

346
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:21,178
your dad must be quite a guy.

347
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:24,410
He is. He's the best.

348
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:27,804
You don't want to lose him,
do you, Walter?

349
00:31:28,128 --> 00:31:29,385
None of us do.

350
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,865
We love him.

351
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:36,351
- He's a good man, isn't he?
- Absolutely. Ask anyone.

352
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:40,393
Anybody.
He's a great father, a great teacher.

353
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:43,181
He knows, like, everything there
is to know about chemistry.

354
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:47,765
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

355
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,131
He's just...

356
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:51,963
decent,

357
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:55,490
and he always does the right thing,

358
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:59,628
that's how he teaches me to be.

359
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,703
Would you say he's your hero?

360
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:03,066
Yes, ma'am.

361
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:06,197
Totally.
My dad is my hero.

362
00:32:15,503 --> 00:32:17,048
Does that put him to sleep?

363
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:20,121
This one just relaxes him a little.

364
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:23,796
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in in just a minute.

365
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:32,418
Here we are.

366
00:32:55,018 --> 00:32:56,118
Relaxed yet?

367
00:32:56,734 --> 00:32:58,334
As a matter of fact...

368
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,798
I don't know what this stuff is,

369
00:33:05,956 --> 00:33:07,307
but it's pretty great.

370
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:10,685
Yeah, it looks like it.

371
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:15,679
We'll be here when you wake up.

372
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,497
I'll be looking for you.

373
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:22,127
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

374
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:23,302
You better.

375
00:33:30,122 --> 00:33:31,572
Where's your phone?

376
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,480
Your cellphone.
Did you bring it?

377
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:35,683
Which one?

378
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:44,211
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

379
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:04,735
First things first.

380
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,398
How old is the baby now?
And when do I finally get to meet her?

381
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:10,467
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but...

382
00:35:10,592 --> 00:35:12,442
She's seven weeks tomorrow.

383
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:14,035
Seven, right?

384
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:15,928
I have a...

385
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:18,161
a picture,

386
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:20,052
here somewhere.

387
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:23,385
She's beautiful.

388
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:27,588
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

389
00:35:28,674 --> 00:35:30,752
How's your pain level, Walter?

390
00:35:32,322 --> 00:35:33,822
Very low, basically.

391
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:36,006
Shortness of breath?

392
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:38,597
A bit, but much better.

393
00:35:38,926 --> 00:35:39,726
Good.

394
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,150
Your margins look good.

395
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:44,197
Obviously,
I can't foresee the future,

396
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:47,085
but even conservatively speaking,
I can say that

397
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,757
you bought yourself
some real time here.

398
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:52,277
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

399
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,552
That's great.

400
00:35:54,662 --> 00:35:56,044
That is great.

401
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:02,301
So, when could he get back
to his normal routine?

402
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,550
He can ease into it now.

403
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:08,443
And can he go back to work or...

404
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:10,350
I'd give it a few more weeks.

405
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:14,936
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

406
00:36:15,061 --> 00:36:17,092
But he can be on his own?

407
00:36:18,522 --> 00:36:20,642
Just more, independent.

408
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,760
Use your best judgment.

409
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,330
That's good news for you, honey?

410
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:30,726
One less baby in the house.

411
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:46,965
Welcome back.

412
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:49,306
Thanks.
It's good to be back.

413
00:36:51,555 --> 00:36:52,782
Jesus.

414
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:55,265
We were all so sorry to hear...

415
00:36:59,243 --> 00:37:00,943
Terrible thing.
Just...

416
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:05,191
But you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and...

417
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:08,016
- You've been doing okay?
- I'm doing okay.

418
00:37:08,331 --> 00:37:09,851
After a certain point,

419
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:11,604
time off doesn't help,

420
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,594
so I figured I'd rather be here,

421
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,125
focus on work.

422
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:18,093
Sure.

423
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:19,327
Absolutely.

424
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:24,504
See you inside.

425
00:37:36,972 --> 00:37:40,144
Truth Or Consequences altimeter,
2-niner-niner-8.

426
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:44,985
Pima 311,
contact Albuquerque Center 134.6.

427
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,241
Juliet 5 Bravo, ident say altitude.

428
00:37:50,116 --> 00:37:53,397
Juliet 5 Bravo, roger.
Cleared direct to Winslow.

429
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:56,441
I think I may just keep this.

430
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:01,309
What do you think?

431
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:05,012
Doesn't look so bad, right?

432
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:08,554
What are you doing?

433
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:11,529
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

434
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,501
- Since when?
- I'm taking the baby with me.

435
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,950
Marie will pick up Walter
Junior from school.

436
00:38:18,075 --> 00:38:20,975
You'll have the house
to yourself for two days.

437
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:24,136
I want you to pack
your things and leave.

438
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,136
Why would I do that?

439
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:29,364
Hank has offered to help, since you
shouldn't be doing any heavy lifting.

440
00:38:30,546 --> 00:38:33,296
I want you gone by Monday morning.
I want...

441
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,353
I want you gone.

442
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,150
Can you at least tell me why?

443
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:51,723
Because you're a liar, Walt.

444
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:55,724
Two cell phones, after all.

445
00:38:57,728 --> 00:38:58,528
What?

446
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:01,458
Right before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone,

447
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:02,733
and you said,

448
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:04,742
"Which one?"

449
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:07,418
When?

450
00:39:09,606 --> 00:39:10,888
I was medicated.

451
00:39:11,013 --> 00:39:13,175
I could have said
the world was flat.

452
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,900
You know what I think?

453
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:18,575
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

454
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:21,925
Honey, we have been over this.

455
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,496
Asked and answered, right?

456
00:39:24,621 --> 00:39:26,493
Then it got me thinking

457
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:30,361
again about all
the strange behavior,

458
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,640
not the least of which was
the disappearance.

459
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:36,181
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals,

460
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:38,247
checking the morgue.

461
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:40,619
Your fugue state.

462
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:46,093
I had to believe that, didn't I?

463
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:48,559
I had to find a way.

464
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,404
I mean...

465
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:54,967
who would lie about such a thing?

466
00:39:55,924 --> 00:39:57,024
You tell me.

467
00:39:57,464 --> 00:40:00,330
You tell me exactly what it
is you think I'm lying about.

468
00:40:00,953 --> 00:40:03,296
What?
I'm having an affair.

469
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:05,234
- Is that what you think?
- Yes.

470
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,403
- For the last few weeks.
- With whom?

471
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:09,421
Who am I having an affair with?

472
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:11,575
My guess was Gretchen Schwartz.

473
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,693
Something was going on between you.

474
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:16,265
I just knew.

475
00:40:16,438 --> 00:40:17,347
Jesus.

476
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,865
Get me a Bible to swear on,
if that's what it takes.

477
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,752
I am not having
an affair with Gretchen.

478
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,908
I know.
I know you're not.

479
00:40:24,062 --> 00:40:25,562
Because I asked her.

480
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:31,264
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

481
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,639
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

482
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:35,770
So I finally left a message...

483
00:40:35,895 --> 00:40:39,145
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

484
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:42,160
I thought that would get her attention,
and it did.

485
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:45,584
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

486
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:49,379
The money for your treatment,

487
00:40:50,921 --> 00:40:54,593
Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

488
00:40:56,383 --> 00:40:57,929
They paid for nothing.

489
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:02,224
You refused every offer they made you.
But that didn't make sense

490
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:05,699
because I checked with Delcavoli
at the hospital, and...

491
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,816
not including your surgery,

492
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,182
we're nearly paid up.

493
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,832
Over $100,000.

494
00:41:15,113 --> 00:41:16,263
Out of where?

495
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,733
Out of thin air?

496
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,850
But then...

497
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:32,391
I called your mother.

498
00:41:37,836 --> 00:41:39,387
Thanks for that, too.

499
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:43,431
But I thought,
maybe she has some money that I don't

500
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:46,099
know about.
Maybe she contributed.

501
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,530
It's possible.

502
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:56,276
It turns out that not only is
the money not from your mother,

503
00:41:57,094 --> 00:42:01,092
she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

504
00:42:05,337 --> 00:42:07,137
You never went to see her.

505
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:11,342
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

506
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:14,000
You were gone for four days, and...

507
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,090
yet she swears...

508
00:42:17,476 --> 00:42:19,276
that you were never there.

509
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:28,118
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

510
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:34,029
Could you...

511
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:36,752
just once...

512
00:42:40,482 --> 00:42:41,882
do me the courtesy

513
00:42:42,255 --> 00:42:43,655
of not denying it?

514
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,017
Don't do this, please.

515
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:03,165
Please don't go.

516
00:43:12,727 --> 00:43:14,427
If I tell you the truth,

517
00:43:15,536 --> 00:43:16,736
will you stay?

518
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,870
Stay, and I will
tell you everything.

519
00:43:23,778 --> 00:43:25,128
Whatever it is...

520
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:28,125
I'm afraid to know.

521
00:43:56,883 --> 00:43:58,902

00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:02,796
