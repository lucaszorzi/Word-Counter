<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,422
<i>Okay, boys! Take it all.
Let's get everything.</i>

3
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:13,101
Put out the lighter.

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,167
He can't keep getting
away with it!

5
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,868
He won't.
Do you really want to burn him down?

6
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:19,929
Let's do it together.
I put a wire on you, let him explain.

7
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:22,026
If I go to this plaza,
I'm a dead man.

8
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:24,881
Next time I'm gonna get you
where you <i>really</i> live.

9
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:26,337
<i>Jesse, listen...</i>

10
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:29,745
Todd, I think I might have
another job for your uncle.

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,813
So, how big's the batch?

12
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:39,798
Should be about 50 pounds,
give or take.

13
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:41,734
Uncle Jack, that mask...

14
00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:44,019
I think you should...

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,323
Mr. White says the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

16
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,158
Let me worry about
what I breathe, kid.

17
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:51,643
Just hurry this up
so I can grab a smoke.

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,868
76%.
[Chuckles]

19
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:34,870
- Nice going, nephew.
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.

20
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:36,355
Where is the blue?

21
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:37,856
Where's the what?

22
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:39,358
The blue color.

23
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:41,994
Does it come later,
when this hardens?

24
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:44,029
Where is it?

25
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:48,801
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

26
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:51,804
See, I'm thinking the headline
here should be "76%."

27
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:54,056
Yeah. Whole lot more
than it was.

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,842
That dude who looked like Wolverine--
he couldn't crack 70.

29
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:58,227
Fine. Yes,

30
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:01,347
percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

31
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,015
And congratulations, Todd.

32
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:05,717
But blue is our brand.
All over Europe,

33
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:08,270
it's what our buyers
pay top dollar for.

34
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,940
If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days,

35
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:12,942
maybe they'll let us
slide on that,

36
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:15,361
but not if it's not blue.

37
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:19,531
I don't know.
To my eye,

38
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:21,200
it's kind of blue.

39
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:22,701
Yeah, a little.

40
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:24,503
It's blue-ish.

41
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:29,875
[Jack] Todd, you're the chef.
What do you think?

42
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,266
Yeah, kinda...

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,301
If it catches the light
just right,

44
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:42,271
I could see how you'd think

45
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:44,256
there's a touch of blue,

46
00:02:44,274 --> 00:02:46,525
blue-green in there.

47
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,926
[Snaps fingers]
Aquamarine.

48
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:49,428
Hell, we'll put
food coloring in it.

49
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:51,063
Make it any damn shade
you want.

50
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:53,432
- Yeah. Like they do farm-raised salmon.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,731
Jesus, you ever see how pink
they make that crap?

52
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:58,701
Like, flamingo pink.

53
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,727
It sure as hell don't come
out the ocean lookin' like that.

54
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,080
All right.
Let's make some money.

55
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:23,929
- Here you go, Ms. Quayle.
- Lydia.

56
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,797
Thank you.

57
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:34,439
Is the tea okay?
I made it just like you asked.

58
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:35,507
Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,509
You sure?
If it's too weak or something,

60
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:39,645
I can go put another bag in it.

61
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,613
I'm sure.

62
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:46,235
Look, about the product...

63
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:48,871
I'm really sorry
about the color.

64
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:51,856
For a minute or two,
it just got a few degrees too hot

65
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,792
in the mixing kettle, I think.

66
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:56,879
I might've just cooked the
color right out of it.

67
00:03:56,913 --> 00:04:00,165
You burned it, like a cake.

68
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:04,303
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

69
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:06,305
But the point is
I think I can fix it,

70
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:09,808
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

71
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:11,876
I mean, I'm doing everything

72
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:15,097
just like Mr. White
taught me, so...

73
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:18,684
You know,
it's bound to get better, right?

74
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:21,320
I appreciate you making
every possible effort,

75
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,821
because, as you know,

76
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:25,390
my buyers expect
a certain threshold,

77
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:26,825
a continuity.

78
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:29,077
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

79
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,235
Uh, about your buyers...

80
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:42,674
I could ask my uncle
to smooth things over with them,

81
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:47,262
if... you want.

82
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:52,884
I'll pass. Thanks.

83
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,688
I've put a lot of faith
in your abilities, Todd.

84
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:59,591
I believe in you.

85
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:02,427
Please do make the cook better.

86
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:05,197
It's very important to me.

87
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,537
I've got a flight to catch.

88
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,297

<i>Hey. It's Walt.</i>

92
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:47,856
Hey, Mr. White.
How you doing?

93
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:49,408
<i>I'm okay.</i>

94
00:05:49,442 --> 00:05:51,159
<i>I, uh...</i>

95
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:54,162
<i>Todd, I think I might have</i>

96
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:56,198
<i>another job for your uncle.</i>

97
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:59,251
Oh, okay. Uh, you want me
to set up a meeting?

98
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:02,587
<i>I-- Yes. Please.</i>
<i>Let's do that.</i>

99
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:06,008
Any heads-up
I should give him, like, um,

100
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:09,661
which jail, how many targets,
stuff like that?

101
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:13,548
- Mr. White?
<i>- Just one target.</i>

102
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:16,218
<i>Not currently in jail.</i>

103
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:18,353
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>

104
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:21,023
You got it.

107
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:18,358
I'm surprised
you didn't strangle him.

108
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:20,319
So, now what? Book him?

109
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:23,488
I'm sure the AUSA have plenty to say
on how to play him against Walt.

110
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:26,625
Knowing what we know about how
Walt deals with rats behind bars? No...

111
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,827
Yeah. Punk has to be safer
with the Marshals watching his back

112
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:31,239
than out here
where it's open season.

Mmmh...

114
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,333
What does that mean?
What are you thinking?

115
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,935
Kid's got an idea.

116
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,355
What kid? That kid?
Timmy Dipshit there?

117
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:42,024
The one that screwed up our sting?
Oh, I'm all ears.

118
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:44,343
Just, uh, hear him out,
will ya?

119
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,536
Okay, genius, what's the idea?

120
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:57,539
You guys need evidence
to put him away,

121
00:07:57,574 --> 00:08:00,376
only he's too smart
to leave any out there, right?

122
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,877
So you say.

123
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,879
Well, I know some evidence

124
00:08:03,913 --> 00:08:06,465
that greedy asshole
would never destroy.

125
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,501
His money.

126
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:11,870
- You know where he keeps his money?
- No.

127
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:14,673
But I know someone who might.

128
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,514
Oh, hey.
How'd it go?

129
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:25,651
Trailed him out to the dog house,
picked him up there.

130
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:27,853
Seemed to be looking
for someone.

131
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:29,355
Had a lot of questions.

132
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:31,357
No calls, though, right?
You got his phone?

133
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:32,608
Yeah.

134
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:36,412

I got Van Oster
babysitting him.

137
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:43,568
Yeah, and what about Van Oster?
Did he have any questions?

138
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:46,038
Probably, but he knows better
than to ask.

139
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,373
Good job.

140
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,508
I gotta tell you this
up front, Hank.

141
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,760
If this guy decides
that he wants to lawyer up,

142
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,429
I don't care
if you are my boss,

143
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,464
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

144
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,516
He won't lawyer up.

145
00:08:59,386 --> 00:09:00,886

146
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,233

00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:17,119
Ugh.

148
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:37,139

00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,234
Hey, there. You mind taking it
outside for a minute?

151
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,603
- No, sir. You got it.
- All right. Thanks.

152
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:54,806
Huell Babineaux.

153
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:58,243
Know who I am?

154
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,580
I'll take that as a yes.

155
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:03,832
Uh, thanks for your patience.

156
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:06,835
Uh, as, uh, Agent Gomez said,

157
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,204
you're-- you're not
under arrest.

158
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:10,873
Why am I here?

159
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:14,009
Well, you're here, uh,
for your own protection, sir.

160
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:15,511
How you figure that?

161
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:19,264
Well, we both know how dangerous
my brother-in-law can be.

162
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,604
Nice poker face.

163
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:27,523
Look, uh, relax.

164
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:30,175
There's not much new you can
tell me about Walter White.

165
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:32,177
Multiple murders,

166
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:34,513
uh, ties to a white power
prison gang,

167
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:37,199
ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

168
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,902
I'm not asking,
you're not answering.

169
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:42,070
Whoop-de-doo.
Let's cut to the chase.

170
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:44,122
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

171
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:46,358
We intercepted a call
between him

172
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:49,044
and a certain Saul Goodman,
esquire.

173
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:51,713
You know, your employer.

174
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:54,800
Anyway, in the call, uh, Walt said
that he was going to, quote,

175
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,469
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman,"
unquote,

176
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:59,388
and that you were next
on the hit list.

177
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:00,722
That's why you're here.

178
00:11:00,757 --> 00:11:03,008
Bullshit.
That don't make no sense.

179
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,544
We got the recording.
I can-- I can let you hear it.

180
00:11:05,562 --> 00:11:08,180
Your associate, Goodman's fixer--
What's his name?

181
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:10,482
Some carrottop
named Patrick Kuby.

182
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:13,151
Boston PD ran him out of
Beantown a few years back.

183
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:14,719
Came out here for the sunshine.

184
00:11:14,737 --> 00:11:17,990
Yeah. Walt said he was gonna do this
Kuby guy the same way he does you.

185
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:20,192
In fact,
Kuby's already missing.

186
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:22,194
Sorry to say,
things are looking grim

187
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:24,062
for your--
your redheaded buddy.

188
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,566
Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

189
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:30,085
Whatever you do,
I would not call Goodman.

190
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,070
He sold you
down the river big-time.

191
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:35,007
- The hell you talkin' about?
- Oh, don't take it personally.

192
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,909
Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

193
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:40,245
And to be fair,
your, uh, circus clown of a boss

194
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:42,264
did try to spare you
for all of, what,

195
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:44,266
about 15 seconds
[Chuckles]

196
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,251
Before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

197
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:49,254
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone,

198
00:11:49,272 --> 00:11:50,922
and as soon as you call him,

199
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,924
uh, Walt's gonna find out
where you're hiding out.

200
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:55,444
And then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

201
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:59,898
[Scoffs]
Oh, man. Oh, man.

202
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:02,484
I swear to God, I didn't know
he was gonna kill the man.

203
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,570
I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
I didn't know.

204
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:06,104
- Relax.
- I didn't know he was gonna kill him.

205
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:07,623
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup

206
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:09,157
for conspiracy to commit murder

207
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,742
instead of here,
under our protection.

208
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:12,744
So just tell us everything
you know about White

209
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:14,246
so we can get him
before he gets you.

210
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,248
Why would he wanna kill me?

211
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,584
- I ain't do nothin' to him.
- Who knows with this guy?

212
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:20,719
From what he said to Goodman,
it may have something to do

213
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:22,387
with him trying
to tie up loose ends

214
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,090
regarding his poisoning
some kid named Brock.

215
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:29,311
Or maybe it's 'cause you know
where his money is.

216
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:31,263
I don't know
where his money is.

217
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,764
That ain't what we heard.

218
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:35,100
Well, you ain't listening
to the people in the know.

219
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:37,235
Me and Kuby
rented a van for the dude,

220
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,105
loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit,

221
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,807
handed over the keys
to him at Goodman's.

222
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:45,160
And who knows
where he took it from there?

223
00:12:45,194 --> 00:12:47,979
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

224
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:50,165
Seven barrels' worth.

225
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,750
Seven barrels?

226
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:55,504
When you--
you say "barrels,"

227
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:57,506
you mean <i>barrels</i> barrels?

228
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,374
Barrels, man.
You know,

229
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:02,761
plastic, black,
55-gallon type.

230
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,262
I got 'em at Home Depot.

231
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:06,932
Filled up every last damn
one of 'em too.

232
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,185
And, uh, where did you
rent the van?

233
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:11,637
Lariat.

234
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:14,172
The one on Candelaria
and Monroe.

235
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:19,010
- Lariat on Candelaria?
- Yeah!

236
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:21,012
Kuby rented the van.

237
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,731
Mr. White dropped it off.

238
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:25,200
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

239
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:26,785
Wash the rental?
Why?

240
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,621
It was filthy, man,
like he had went off road with it.

241
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,874
After we had hosed it down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back,

242
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:35,627
handed over the key,
and that was it.

243
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:37,045
That's all I know.

244
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:42,751
All right, uh, Mr. Babineaux.

245
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:45,721
Agent Gomez and I

246
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:48,390
are going to, uh,
do everything we can

247
00:13:48,424 --> 00:13:50,342
to find the son of a bitch.

248
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:52,144
Meantime, like I said,
you're free to go.

249
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,730
But if I were you,
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

250
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:57,399
[Gomez] Right. And
remember, no phone calls.

251
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,184
Oh, almost forgot.

252
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,520
Uh, I took the liberty
of removing the battery

253
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,822
so Walt can't, uh,
track you by GPS.

254
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:06,742
So don't put that back in.

255
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:09,027
Agent Van Oster
will stay here with you.

256
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:11,413
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

257
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:13,732
Uh, however, don't discuss
the case with him,

258
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,401
because the less
you distract him,

259
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:19,087
the better he can protect you.

260
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:21,256
How long you gonna be?

261
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:24,543
As long as it takes
to keep you safe.

262
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:39,191
[Jack]
So just one guy this time.

263
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,476
Not even in lockup.

264
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:47,399
Some former partner, Todd says?

265
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:50,952
Yeah.

266
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:53,238
So what are we talking,
rat patrol?

267
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:57,042
"Rat p--"

268
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:59,661
No, no.

269
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:02,998
"Rat patrol"?
No. No, he's not a rat.

270
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:06,284
He's just...

271
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,338
He-- he just...

272
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:12,557
won't listen to reason.

273
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:14,810
- Okay.
- He's just angry.

274
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:16,595
He's not a rat.

275
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,630
All right.

276
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:22,100
Angry, non-rat.
Got it.

277
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:23,852
How angry we talkin',
by the way?

278
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,804
Like, Hulk angry?

279
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:30,776
Like, "Rambo James Bond
badass" individual?

280
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,832
Not something
you'd do yourself, huh?

281
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,952
Jesse is like family to me.

282
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:45,323
Look, I want what you do
to be quick

283
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:46,991
and painless.

284
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:49,094
No suffering, no fear.

285
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:52,264
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

286
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:54,182
I respect that.

287
00:15:54,217 --> 00:15:55,884
There's too many savages
out there.

288
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,836
Let's just talk
about the money.

289
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:00,021
[Chuckling] No,
we don't want your money.

290
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,275
We want you to cook for us.

291
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,227
[Scoffs]

292
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:16,071
You know I'm
out of the business.

293
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:18,824
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

294
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:22,026
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

295
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:24,696
Get the color right too.

296
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:27,549
Apparently that blue touch
you put on it--

297
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,001
it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

298
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:31,503
So I'm told.

299
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:34,289
No. Absolutely not.

300
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:38,210
Look, what was the price
per head last time? I'll triple it.

301
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:41,714
That's a drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

302
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:44,416
Don't skimp on family.
That's what I always say.

303
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,135
You want us to do this job?

304
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:49,138
Do it right?
That's the price.

305
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:03,235
One cook...

306
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:05,988
after the job is done.

307
00:17:24,957 --> 00:17:27,125
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

308
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:29,478
We'll do him tonight
if you want.

309
00:17:29,512 --> 00:17:31,513
Just tell me where he is.

310
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:34,483
I don't know where he is,

311
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:38,470
but I know how
to flush him out.

312
00:17:41,995 --> 00:17:44,163
You want String Cheese
or Yogurt Squeezers

313
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,665
with your PBJ?

314
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,583
Both.

315
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,586
- I didn't hear you.
- Both, please.

316
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:53,806
[Knock on door]

317
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:57,143
Hold on, honey.

318
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,847
Hi, Andrea.

319
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,565
I don't know
if you remember me.

320
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,817
I'm Walter White,
Jesse's friend.

321
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:06,903
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course. Hi.

322
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:08,404
Yeah. Oh, hi. Hi.

323
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:11,441
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this,

324
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:15,244
but, uh, I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

325
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:17,530
It's about Jesse.

326
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,333
Um, okay. Sure. But I'm sort of
rushing around right now.

327
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,368
You wanna talk inside while
I get my boy ready for school?

328
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,036
Uh, well, yeah.
If it's--

329
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,905
if it's okay, yeah, sure.

330
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:27,907
Thank you.

331
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,842
You met Brock before, right?

332
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:32,795
Yes. Yes, I have.
At Jesse's.

333
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,597
How you doing, Brock?

334
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:39,485
Brock, he asked you a question.

335
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,221
- I'm good.
- Good.

336
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:44,140
Froot Loops.

337
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:46,526
That's good stuff.

338
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:49,328
[Quietly]
So... Jesse.

339
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:50,830
Yeah. I--

340
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,565
I don't wanna alarm you,

341
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,234
but I've-- I've been trying
to reach him for days.

342
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,736
I've stopped at his house.

343
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,338
I've left all kinds of messages
on his voicemail,

344
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:00,840
and he won't return my calls.

345
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,658
I can't find him anywhere.

346
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,610
Have you heard from him?

347
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:07,112
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

348
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:08,631
That was--
I don't know--

349
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,716
two weeks ago, maybe.

350
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,053
Andrea...

351
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,622
Jesse's using again,

352
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,558
and I-- I--

353
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:21,010
I have a bad feeling
about this.

354
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:24,847
Have you tried
calling the police?

355
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:29,435
Or, um--
a better idea.

356
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,805
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

357
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,607
I mean, he may have ways
of finding Jesse

358
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,325
without, you know,
getting him in trouble.

359
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,695
"Better Call Saul."
Yeah. I-- I did that.

360
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,198
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up.

361
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:46,419
But otherwise,
very little help.

362
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:49,956
See, the thing is

363
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,209
is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

364
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,679
And I-- I won't bore you
with the details, but, uh,

365
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:59,265
he's-- he's--

366
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:03,302
he's pretty upset
with me, and, uh--

367
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:06,305
and I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back

368
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,107
instead of...

369
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,860
him being...

370
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:12,912
Well...

371
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,850
Well, I'll try him right now.

372
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:20,736
I mean, if that's it--
he's mad at you,

373
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,405
maybe I'll have better luck.
[Phone beeps]

374
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,707
That would be such a help. Yes.
[Dialing phone number]

375
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:27,860
What, um-- what-- what number
are you, uh, calling him on?

376
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:30,046
- Um, his cell.
- Ah. Yeah. You know,

377
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,048
he recently gotten a new one.

378
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:34,000
And there. That--

379
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:37,136
that's his new number there--
the highlighted one.

380
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,243
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

381
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:45,745
Your friend Walter
just dropped by.

382
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,780
He's here at the house
with me and Brock right now.

383
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,316
We, uh--
we're thinking of you.

384
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,551
Call me back as soon as
you get this message, okay?

385
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,320
I really need to hear from you.

386
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,405
It's important.

387
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,725
Thank you, Andrea.

388
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:02,445
I appreciate that.

389
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,780
Well, I better--
I better be going.

390
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,833
Oh, you're welcome to stay a
few minutes to see if he calls back.

391
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,369
No. No, no. You're trying to
get your son off to school.

392
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,788
Listen, if he does happen to
call back, would you call me?

393
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,073
Better yet--

394
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:17,126
I've got your number.
I'll call you back, okay?

395
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:19,762
And... thank you.

396
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:22,381
See ya, Brock.

397
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:25,935
[Door opens]

[Phone buzzes, beeps]

401
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:53,612
We on?

402
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,382
Yes. It should be
any time now.

403
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,301
<i>Copy that.</i>

404
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:01,837
Remember, fast and painless.
And take him away from here.

405
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:04,857
I don't want the mother
or the boy to know.

406
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,726
<i>You got it.</i>

407
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:09,929

[Beeps]

417
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:32,168
Nice try, asshole.

418
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:50,603
How'd it go
at the rental place?

419
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,471
Van have GPS?

420
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,306
No GPS. Nope.

421
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,443
They used to have GPS
until about six months ago,

422
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:00,029
when the ACLU
or somebody sued them,

423
00:23:00,063 --> 00:23:02,365
and they had to get rid of it.

424
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:03,916
[Sighs]

425
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,822
Well, that's it.
Game over.

426
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:12,858
Yo, man, you can't
just give up on this.

427
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:15,494
- Who said we're giving up?
[Gomez] - What do you got?

428
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,863
Just thinking about
what Babineaux said

429
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:19,364
about the van being dirty

430
00:23:19,383 --> 00:23:21,751
and the shovel
that Walt had with him.

431
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:24,203
I'll bet you 10-to-1
he buried that money.

432
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:26,422
No kidding.
So what?

433
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:28,424
There's a whole lot
of desert out there.

434
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,092
How are we gonna find
the right spot?

435
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,544
You said it yourself,
there's no GPS on the van.

436
00:23:32,562 --> 00:23:36,098
Yeah. But Walt
doesn't know that.

437
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:40,809
All right.

438
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,145
Here's your change.

439
00:23:43,196 --> 00:23:45,147
- Oh, um, count it out, please.
- Here.

440
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:47,265
Uh, three.
That makes 15.

441
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:50,068
Plus five.
That is 20.

442
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:52,237
Give this to
your car wash professional.

443
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:53,572
Thank you.

444

Oh, you too.

447
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:01,279
- Good.
- Why-- why do I--

448
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:03,248
why do I gotta say that?

449
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:05,667
Because it reinforces
our brand.

450
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:07,753
So, getting the hang of it?

451
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:10,806
It's, uh-- it's--
it's pretty basic.

452
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:13,792
Mom, it's Saturday.

453
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,794
Can-- can I go?

454
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,495
- Go where?
- Home.

455
00:24:17,513 --> 00:24:20,966
Um, pick up a few things,
maybe chill for a little bit.

456
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,185
I'm sure the smell
is gone by now.

457
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:26,021
Why don't you just stick around here
for a while longer, all right?

458
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:27,973
- I need you.
- Hi.

459
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:30,108
Uh, who do I give this to?

460
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:32,110
Um, you know what?
I'll take care of it.

461
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:33,695

00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,594
I like your commercial.

475
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:07,312
What-- what happened
to your face?

476
00:25:07,346 --> 00:25:10,515
Uh, this is a-- I guess you'd call it
an occupational hazard.

477
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,384
Okay, so thank you, and please give that
to your car wash professional.

478
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:15,770
Very good. Thank you very much.
Good to meet you.

479
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,572
- Yeah.
- Don't drink and drive.

480
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:20,575
But if you do, call me.

you forgot to say it.

00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,782
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Okay.

484
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:31,920
Make sure you get in there
between the cushions, all right?

485
00:25:31,954 --> 00:25:35,257
That's it. Way in there.
Attaboy.

No idea. AWOL.

00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,608
Nobody's seen him.
He's not answering his phone.

494
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:55,560
So what about Jesse?

495
00:25:55,578 --> 00:25:57,562
He hasn't shown up yet.

496
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,198
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite somewhere

497
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:02,117
and hasn't gotten
our message yet.

498
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:04,786
Or he got it loud and clear
and figured out it's a setup.

499
00:26:04,837 --> 00:26:07,622
The kid is not as dumb
as you think.

500
00:26:13,412 --> 00:26:16,681
Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

501
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:19,417
Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

502
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:22,354
Look, I had him
watching the dog house,

503
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:24,356
figuring the kid might show up
for a fix.

504
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,524
Next thing I know,
radio silence.

505
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,927
You're the math whiz.
Add up two and two.

506
00:26:28,945 --> 00:26:31,980
Jesse is not on
some killing spree.

507
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:34,032
It's me he wants.

508
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,767
It's just me.

509
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:37,602
Then where the hell's Huell?

510
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:45,577
Any news?

511
00:26:45,611 --> 00:26:47,779
Not yet, but soon.
I promise.

512
00:26:47,797 --> 00:26:50,632
- Have an A-1 day.
- Okay.

513
00:26:55,054 --> 00:26:57,472
Next--

514
00:26:57,506 --> 00:27:00,175
inventory lists.

515

(Skyler speaks indistinctly)

516
00:27:13,639 --> 00:27:16,241
...uh, ten pine-scented
air fresheners.

517
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:18,309
You mark "ten"

00:40:30,147 --> 00:40:32,014
[Yelling]
Back off! Back off!

694
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:33,432
Get over here!
Get over here!

695
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:35,935
- Get in the truck!
- Bring it, bitch!

696
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:37,853
- Put him in the car!
- Come on!

697
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:40,323
Get in the car!
Hurry up! Get in.

698
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:46,112
Get in the car, kid.
Come on.

699
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:52,451
[Car door opens]

700
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:57,656
Gonna take him down
for booking, okay?

701
00:40:57,674 --> 00:41:00,459
I think you should stay here
till I come back with a search team.

702
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:02,461
You got it.
I'd take the kid with me,

703
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:05,014
[Chuckling] but they'd probably
kill each other on the way.

704
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,031
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Hey.

705
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:16,525
I'll call the Tribal Police on the way out,
let 'em know we're here.

706
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,178
Gonna make a phone call.

707
00:41:24,368 --> 00:41:27,019
[Beeps, automatic dialing]

708
00:41:30,857 --> 00:41:32,858

00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:34,910
[Beeps]

710
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:39,265
Hank, why is there what looks
like brains in our garbage can?

711
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:41,550
Hey, baby. I got him.

712
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,252
Dead to rights.

713
00:41:44,554 --> 00:41:46,305
You got Walt?

714
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,640
<i>Yeah.</i>

715
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:50,476
<i>I got him in handcuffs</i>
<i>as we speak.</i>

716
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:54,263
<i>Want me to wave to him</i>
<i>for you? Huh?</i>

717
00:41:57,234 --> 00:41:59,652
[Chuckles]
Well, he's not, uh--

718
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,687
he's not feeling too friendly.

719
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:04,723
Oh, my God.

720
00:42:04,741 --> 00:42:07,360
You did it.

721
00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:09,028
Thank God.

722
00:42:09,062 --> 00:42:10,746
<i>Things are gonna be</i>

723
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:14,300
a little rough for the next couple weeks,
but they'll get better.

724
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:20,756
Baby, you okay?

725
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,259
[Sniffles]

726
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:25,461
I'm much better now.

727
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:30,216
I gotta go.

728
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,251
It may be awhile
before I get home.

729
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:38,107
I love you.

730
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,310
I love you too.

731
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:44,897
[Beeps]

732
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:46,148
[Exhales forcefully]

733
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:12,475
Who the hell is this?

734
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:14,510
Tribal Police?

735
00:43:16,813 --> 00:43:20,266
Hank! Hank! Hank!

736
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:39,034
No--

737
00:43:47,344 --> 00:43:49,828
Police!
Drop your weapons!

738
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:53,182
Jack, don't do it!
[Panting]

739
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:54,800
Jack!

740
00:43:57,504 --> 00:44:00,556
Drop... your... weapons!

741
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:02,858
You heard the man!
Put 'em down!

742
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:05,844
[Jack]
How do we know you're cops?

743
00:44:05,862 --> 00:44:07,980
Show us some ID!

744
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:11,901
Damn straight!
Let's see some badges!

745
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:13,569
Jack!

746
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,688
Jack, don't do it!
Jack!

747
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:21,494
No, Jack! It's off!
Jack!

748
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:24,580
[Jack] We'll give ourselves up
if you show us some badges!

749
00:44:27,384 --> 00:44:29,385
Simple as that!

750
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,721
How 'bout it?

751
00:44:32,756 --> 00:44:34,590
[Walt]
No!

752

Jack, it's off!

755
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:45,684
Forget it!

00:44:45,718 --> 00:44:47,386
Jack!
