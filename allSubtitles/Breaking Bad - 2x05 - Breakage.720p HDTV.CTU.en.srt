Previously on <i>Breaking Bad</i>...

00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:05,421
Marie is a shoplifter.

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:10,509
We are not going to have this
in our house. We need you to leave.

4
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,962
I can't pay you today.

5
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:15,683
Here's my counter-offer.
I take payment from your inventory.

6
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,101
Look what they gave me.
The grill of the guy I shot.

7
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,902
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,519

10
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,721
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

11
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,667
Here at the end of round one,

12
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:05,392
I'm going to recommend
cautious optimism.

13
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:09,197
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded, reassess,

14
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,273
and decide our next move, if any.

15
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:14,235
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

16
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:19,715
Try to think of this as good timing.

17
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,322
You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself,

18
00:03:22,447 --> 00:03:24,997
and your hair should start
to come back.

19
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,670
I kind of gotten used
to the old cue ball look.

20
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,126
I prefer to think of it
as streamlined.

21
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,557
Aerodynamic.

22
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,360
No more confusion?

23
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:42,721
Absolutely none.

24
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:45,349
How are you two holding up?

25
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:48,644
Fine.

26
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,856
I mean, you know, we're busy, but...

27
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,381
we're good.

28
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:54,556
Absolutely.

29
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:57,654
It's all good.

30
00:04:02,713 --> 00:04:05,823
So, we're not going through
an insurer. Is that correct?

31
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:07,298
Yes. Direct bill.

32
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,385
Just need to print it out for you.

33
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,346
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

34
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,132
Absolutely. It's included.

35
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,054
Just a reminder,

36
00:04:56,701 --> 00:05:00,351
we do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

37
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:08,355
Congratulations.

38
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:26,367
Then, what about the MRI?

39
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,310
Can you please explain to me

40
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:32,535
the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

41
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:38,879
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

42
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,176
It should be covered.

43
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:47,352
You bet I will.
Yeah, in triplicate.

44
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:51,575
Well, I'm sorry you couldn't be
of more help, too.

45
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:56,328
Bitch.

46
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,721
Been around someone who smokes?

47
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,712
The hospital bill came.

48
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,164
That was fast.

49
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,162
Three-day stay:
$13,000 and counting.

50
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:21,328
Is this something that

51
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:24,547
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

52
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:31,007
I know it's strictly
your domain, but...

53
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:33,878
They will.
I'm sure they will.

54
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,441
I'll handle it.

55
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:31,728
Christ.

56
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:17,959
- Bring me up to speed on Salamanca.
- Dead.

57
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:19,734
- Still?
- Completely.

58
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,542
Okay, then.
Well, thanks for stopping by.

59
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,777
So things are quiet. Not a lot
of crystal on the streets right now.

60
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:29,831
Good.

61
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:31,361
That's not going to last.

62
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,573
Waiting to see who rallies the roaches
now that his turf's up for grabs.

63
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:36,179
No takers so far?

64
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:39,068
We keep hearing a name. Heisenberg.

65
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:42,331
Lately, pretty much every
dime-bagger we come across.

66
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,578
- Heisenberg?
- Yeah, I know.

67
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,253
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

68
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:51,760
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

69
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:54,298
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

70
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,900
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

71
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:02,903
'Cause they have three sets of teeth

72
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:05,428
and will take a bite
out of anything?

73
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:08,904
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles

74
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:10,779
in pursuit of their prey.

75
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:12,949
Yeah, I think I heard that.

76
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,750
You, my friend, are a great white.

77
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:20,244
How does Albuquerque Liaison,

78
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,479
Tri-state Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

79
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,455
Like one hell of a promotion.

80
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,345
As of the 1st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

81
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,883
What you gonna do without me, Gomie?

82
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:35,979
Celebrate.

83
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:38,841
I won't have to look at your
ugly mug six days a week.

84
00:10:38,966 --> 00:10:41,733
Hey, buddy, I am the
brains and the brawn.

85
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:44,375
- I'm the whole package.
- I'm glad I didn't just eat.

86
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,973
I'm surprised his head
still fits through the door.

87
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:48,772
- Wanna grab lunch?
- Hell, yeah.

88
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,692
- 'Cause you're buying.
- Done.

89
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,859
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

90
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:54,945
Try not to get lost on the way.

91
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:01,026
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked, too.

92
00:11:01,478 --> 00:11:03,036
Yeah, El Paso.

93
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,707
Here's the man.

94
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,711
Congratulations.

95
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:16,029
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest.

96
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:19,749
And then he says, "Give me a four."

97
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:55,804
You got some nerve coming back here.

98
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,642
Or you're even dumber
than I thought.

99
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:00,457
Maybe both.

100
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,540
Balance for the tow, the repairs,

101
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,024
and extra for, you know,
damages and stuff to the gate,

102
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:18,804
the toilet...

103
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:22,594
Look, like I said,

104
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,529
my word is my bond.

105
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,568
What would you charge me
to store this here?

106
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:46,363
- A million-five.
- Come on, yo.

107
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:48,263
Your sister.

108
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:51,052
Dawg, I'm serious, all right?
I got storage needs.

109
00:13:51,177 --> 00:13:53,490
And I got scratch up front.

110
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:56,626
We could, you know, negotiate.

111
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:02,907
500.

112
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:04,759
- A month?
- A week.

113
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:08,145
For real?

114
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,557
- See ya.
- Wait.

115
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,475
Just hold on. Just chill.

116
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,723
Sounds good.
Totally doable.

117
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:19,774
- Outside.
- Inside.

118
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,247
- Forget it.
- Man, come on.

119
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:24,784
Your fence is too easy to climb.

120
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,894
Inside, padlocked,
plus gate privileges.

121
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,228
- Come again?
- Gate, in and out, privileges.

122
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:35,197
Month to month.
Cash up front.

123
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:36,485
Inside.

124
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:39,211
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

125
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,791
You selling?

126
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,812
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

127
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:07,378
What about that one?

128
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:12,475
Serious?

129
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:36,643
It's Jane, right?

130
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:41,145
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

131
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,270
Really?
Does it inspire awe?

132
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:45,418
No. I mean, it's great.

133
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:47,855
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

134
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,764
I had an entire house before,

135
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,240
detached and all,

136
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:55,165
but I was just tired of all the lawn
care and upkeep and whatnot.

137
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:58,707
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

138
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:01,367
Jesus.

139
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:05,950
Utilities are included.

140
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:08,199
Stacking. Sweet.

141
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:10,279
- You got cable?
- Already wired.

142
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,030
Just call to activate.
High speed, whatever.

143
00:16:13,155 --> 00:16:14,933
Bathroom, cool tile.

144
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:17,251
Bedroom.

145
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:18,775
Nice.

146
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,603
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

147
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,500
So? You're interested?

148
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,935
Definitely.

149
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:29,084
And you're good with NPNS?

150
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,008
Sorry. What?

151
00:16:33,257 --> 00:16:36,911
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
You want to smoke, you do it outside.

152
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:40,780
- It's cool. No worries.
- The usual drill.

153
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:43,793
I'll need a W-2 or a recent pay stub,
current employer,

154
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,546
former address,
you know, the yadda-yadda.

155
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:49,915
And if it's all copasetic,
I'll call.

156
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:53,340
Look,

157
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,977
the thing is I can...

158
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:59,159
Unbelievable.

159
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:03,229
- I'm currently in-between situations.
- And I'm currently not renting.

160
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,857
I got the money
and I'm totally good for it

161
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,067
for, like, ever.

162
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:10,737
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

163
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,616
Yo, my dad's not really a
"make exceptions" kind of guy.

164
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,702
- Trust me.
- Your dad?

165
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:18,232
Owns the place. I manage it.

166
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:23,192
Pen on paper, that's what I need.
Or go run your game somewhere else.

167
00:17:23,566 --> 00:17:25,902
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This is it.

168
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:27,977
And I got no game, all right?

169
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,065
I just need a chance.

170
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:37,760
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

171
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:40,767
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

172
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,952
Didn't meet
their expectations, again.

173
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:47,066
So, you know, now
I'm <i>persona non</i> "gratis" or whatever.

174
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:51,191
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

175
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:53,868
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

176
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:56,621
I will not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

177
00:18:05,904 --> 00:18:07,127
Rent just went up.

178
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,376
A hundred more a month.

179
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,101
That's the cash price.

180
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:16,836
You rock.
You won't regret this.

181
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,070
And, in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

182
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:22,434
DBAA fee, nonrefundable.

183
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,011
Of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously.

184
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,127
What's DBAA?

185
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:35,734
- "Don't be an asshole."
- Gotcha.

186
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,364
I live next door.

187
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
Really?

188
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:41,988
And don't think for one second you have
squatters' rights, because you don't.

189
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:43,788
If you blow this, I want you gone.

190
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,962
I know guys that'll have
your skinny ass

191
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:49,187
out back by the dumpster
faster than you can blink.

192
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,365
I'll fill it in.
Just sign your name.

193
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,347
Which is what, by the way?

194
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:56,522
It's Jesse.

195
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,410
Jesse Jackson.

196
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:03,349
Seriously?

197
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,685
What?

198
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:57,882
- What are you doing?
- Beatin' off. What's it look like?

199
00:19:58,007 --> 00:20:01,308
That is, in fact, exactly
what it looks like to me.

200
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,827
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

201
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:07,498
Christmas, the batch of '06?
Come on.

202
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:10,291
So, let me get this straight.

203
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,555
You call in sick
the day after receiving

204
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,101
a long-awaited,
career-boosting promotion

205
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,248
so you can play Oktoberfest
in your man cave?

206
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,639
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

207
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:26,314
Babe, relax.

208
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:30,144
Please, don't tell me to relax.

209
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,535
- You know I hate that.
- Right.

210
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,524
Dave said I should express that.

211
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,235
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

212
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:39,812
I can take a day.

213
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:41,283
No big deal.

214
00:20:42,402 --> 00:20:45,698
Now, get that sweet ass out of here

215
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:47,373
so I can concentrate.

216
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,355
Okay, so what's the plan?

217
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:39,781
The plan is we cook.

218
00:22:40,111 --> 00:22:44,003
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

219
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:57,097
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

220
00:22:57,222 --> 00:23:00,067
Say if I cooked during the days
and you worked the nights.

221
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,754
- Dude.
- What?

222
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:05,125
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't it?

223
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,813
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before,

224
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,907
but still, what choice do we have?

225
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:12,243
First of all, there's no "we."

226
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:16,354
You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

227
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,729
I got profile now.

228
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:21,057
Don't you get that?
A D.A.'s up my ass.

229
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,840
I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

230
00:23:24,965 --> 00:23:27,365
- No way.
- Then what do you suggest?

231
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:31,624
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

232
00:23:37,356 --> 00:23:38,940
I got bills, man.

233
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,461
You've got bills?

234
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,480
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

235
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:46,468
I've already lost more than I have made,
and I am tired

236
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,342
of dicking around out here.

237
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:51,146
You want to know
how much I've got left?

238
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:54,136
After completing
my first round of treatment

239
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:57,344
and financing the world's
most expensive alibi?

240
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:59,771
Zero! Zip! Nothing!

241
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,086
I've got nothing to show
for all of this.

242
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:06,208
Nothing for my family, which, as you
might remember, was the damn point!

243
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,690
But seeing as throwing in
the towel is not an option,

244
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:17,108
that leaves us with
a total of two choices.

245
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:20,695
We go into business with yet
another homicidal lunatic

246
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,370
or you and I start...

247
00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:25,965
You selling whatever you can.

248
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:31,287
There's a third way.

249
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,950
And what would that be?

250
00:24:36,995 --> 00:24:39,613
We got to be Tuco.

251
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:42,730
Cut out the middle man.
Run our own game.

252
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:45,638
So you're going to, what?

253
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,090
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

254
00:24:49,215 --> 00:24:52,408
You gonna beat your homies to death
when they dis you?

255
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,541
Look, I know some guys.
All right?

256
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,316
I can create a network.

257
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:00,997
We control production
and distribution.

258
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:04,784
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

259
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:07,487
The point here
is to make money, right?

260
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:09,327
Sky-high stacks.

261
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:15,930
- That's not the point?
- No, I am not willing to do that.

262
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,724
Who said anything about you?

263
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:23,979
I don't vote for this plan.

264
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:28,158
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown enties into our operation.

265
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:31,028
You don't get to vote.

266
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,090
I beg your pardon?

267
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:37,992
This is a partnership, remember?

268
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:39,486
I remember.

269
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:42,255
You cook, I sell.

270
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,776
That was the division of labor
when we started all this.

271
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:48,205
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

272
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,889
'Cause I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk

273
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:53,461
or on my knees with a gun to my head

274
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:56,596
before your greedy old ass
came along, all right?

275
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:06,776
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

276
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:10,026
And perhaps I was overly ambitious.

277
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:14,097
But in any case, it's not gonna
happen that way anymore.

278
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:16,532
Damn straight.
Know why?

279
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:19,945
'Cause we do things
my way this time,

280
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:21,646
or I walk.

281
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:28,506
You need me more than I need you.

282
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:51,083
Enter my <i>casa</i>.

283
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,403
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?

284
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,767
Eh, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

285
00:26:56,945 --> 00:26:58,895
Good deal, mover.
Good deal.

286
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:01,793
Yo. Badge, hey.

287
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:03,751
Cool crib, man.

288
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:06,769
It echoes.

289
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,846
Let me give you a virtual tour.

290
00:27:12,971 --> 00:27:15,189
Plasma is gonna go right here.

291
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,551
Probably, like,
a 50-inch wall-mounted.

292
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,100
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

293
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:21,988
Nah. They burn in, yo.

294
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:25,383
But the picture's way sharper.
Blacks are deeper, too.

295
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:27,979
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

296
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,946
That's what I'm waiting for.

297
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:32,022
- Porn, cuz!
- Jesus.

298
00:27:32,355 --> 00:27:35,067
Like, 3-D ta-tas,
like, right in your face.

299
00:27:35,192 --> 00:27:38,906
So, I'm gonna get a couple of those
zero-gravity chairs for right here,

300
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,101
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

301
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,535
Those are buck.

302
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,784
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asian-y, modern stuff.

303
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,662
Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.

304
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:50,213
And I'm thinking,
just a bunch of candles,

305
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:53,963
maybe one of those little fountain jobs
right here. It's gonna be chill.

306
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:58,163
The ladies, they cream up real nice
for, like, candles and shit.

307
00:27:59,897 --> 00:28:02,338
You are going to score, big time!

308
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:06,642
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

309
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:10,396
There's some refreshments over here
if you want to partake.

310
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:13,304
You got any other refreshments?

311
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:16,604
I could kick it.
It's been a while.

312
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,921
I could totally
go for a lovin' spoonful.

313
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:22,659
No bomb, no beer, no weed.

314
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:26,245
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

315
00:28:27,794 --> 00:28:30,166
So listen up.
This is how it goes.

316
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,809
I front each of you an ounce.

317
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,177
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

318
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:40,052
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

319
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,492
2,500 an ounce?

320
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,832
That's kinda, like, hopeful, bro.

321
00:28:45,178 --> 00:28:47,741
Street's maybe 17, 18.

322
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:52,297
This is the best shiz ever.

323
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:55,405
Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second,

324
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,780
who else is selling right now, huh?

325
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:01,192
- It's dry out there, that's for sure.
- Church.

326
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:04,723
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

327
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:07,995
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

328
00:29:08,353 --> 00:29:10,204
Short me, you're out.

329
00:29:10,693 --> 00:29:12,208
Cut it, you're out.

330
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,610
Period.

331
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:17,709
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

332
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:19,373
Understand?

333
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,067
Badger, what is this?

334
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:26,453
A big opportunity.

335
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,012
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

336
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:33,979
Gentlemen, how far you go
is up to you.

337
00:29:34,312 --> 00:29:36,262
So bring out the product, yo.

338
00:29:36,594 --> 00:29:38,567
Not here, all right?
Not ever.

339
00:29:39,008 --> 00:29:41,908
Blind drop.
I will let you know when and where.

340
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,149
All right?

341
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,320
You'll be hearing from me.

342
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,439
Now, I got mad volume,

343
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:53,668
so you move it quick,
you move it right.

344
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,895
There is always more.

345
00:29:59,828 --> 00:30:01,924
DBAA, mo-fos.

346
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:04,049
All right? Apply yourselves.

347
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,495
It's an armpit.

348
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:47,278
It's not an armpit.

349
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,364
Excuse me.
You're right.

350
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:52,476
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

351
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,851
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

352
00:30:55,131 --> 00:30:58,050
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

353
00:30:58,628 --> 00:30:59,783
Human heads,

354
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:04,354
they leave. The cartels,
they litter the place with human heads.

355
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,615
Pretty sure that's
why I'm going there.

356
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,203
It's like a calling card
or a shout-out or something.

357
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:15,581
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

358
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:18,558
You just do
your time like a good boy,

359
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:21,587
and I could see us in
a cute little condo in Georgetown

360
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,305
in a couple of years.

361
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:39,807
I went online

362
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:42,384
to this fantastic

363
00:31:44,124 --> 00:31:46,024
real estate website for D.C.

364
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:51,206
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

365
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,839
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

366
00:31:54,964 --> 00:31:57,603
The one with the helmet hair
and the permanent lip liner.

367
00:31:57,728 --> 00:31:59,728
Anyway, she was saying that...

368
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:06,727
Apologize.

369
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:10,386
What?

370
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:12,779
I will not listen

371
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:14,543
to one more word

372
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:17,659
until you apologize.

373
00:32:20,825 --> 00:32:21,691
For?

374
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,581
You know perfectly well, Marie.

375
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:26,382
- Well, obviously I don't...
- Your lies.

376
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,671
To me.

377
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,219
The shoplifting?

378
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,220
All of it?

379
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:36,521
Did you really think it was all just

380
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:38,244
neatly gonna go away?

381
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,792
If you hadn't tried to return it...

382
00:32:42,285 --> 00:32:43,544
Apologize.

383
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:49,300
Now or never. I mean it.

384
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,530
Or it'll never be the same.

385
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,142
Why are you punishing me?

386
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:00,878
If you don't respect me

387
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:04,592
enough to apologize,
to tell me the truth, then...

388
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:15,608
I need my sister back.

389
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,042
I'm sorry.

390
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
I'm sorry.

391
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:47,900
You want the gory details?

392
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,521
No, you don't.

393
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:54,924
Keep you up at night.

394
00:33:56,193 --> 00:33:56,999
So...

395
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,166
was it scary?

396
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:04,145
Hell, yeah, it was freakin' scary,
you little punk.

397
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,167
Jesus.

398
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:07,797
But you were way faster than him.

399
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,829
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

400
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:15,352
Hell, yeah.
Kick ass and take names.

401
00:34:15,477 --> 00:34:17,473
- Son.
- Nah, it's fine.

402
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:20,953
You know what it is?

403
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:24,948
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

404
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:27,508
I mean, you don't think about it.

405
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:29,484
You stomp 'em down.

406
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,404
Where do they come from?

407
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:36,825
Criminals, like the one you...

408
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:41,453
What do you think it is
that makes them who they are.

409
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:46,643
Buddy, you might as well be asking me
about the roaches.

410
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:50,583
All I know
is there's a whole armada.

411
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,507
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

412
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:10,953
Cops!

413
00:38:10,106 --> 00:38:11,856
I wasn't sure it was you.

414
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:13,999
New car?

415
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:17,877
Keeping things on the D.L.

416
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:21,420
I'm guessing this one
doesn't bounce.

417
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,182
Your half.

418
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,769
15K.
That's what I'm talking about.

419
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:38,765
You're welcome.

420
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,162
Jesus.

421
00:38:42,784 --> 00:38:44,984
Help me understand the math, okay?

422
00:38:45,162 --> 00:38:47,062
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

423
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,202
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

424
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:54,289
$1,000 each.
1 pound, that's 16 ounces.

425
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:58,938
16 ounces should net to me $16,000.

426
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:00,469
16,

427
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:02,547
not 15.

428
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:05,550
Something came up.

429
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:08,448
Something came up?

430
00:39:08,573 --> 00:39:11,640
One of my guys got held up
by a couple junkies.

431
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:15,687
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

432
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:19,811
So you're saying that

433
00:39:20,308 --> 00:39:23,975
your guy got robbed.
Or, rather, you got robbed,

434
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:26,581
but it doesn't matter.

435
00:39:27,722 --> 00:39:30,103
Dude, it's called "breakage," okay?

436
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,411
Like K-Mart. Shit breaks.

437
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:34,579
And you're thinking
this is acceptable?

438
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:37,521
It's the cost of business, yo.

439
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:41,211
- You're sweating me over a grand?
- Look, I'm just the chemist, here.

440
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,353
I'm not the street guy, yo.

441
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:47,949
But it seems to me that
what you call "breakage" is just you

442
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:49,886
making a fool of yourself.

443
00:39:50,694 --> 00:39:52,973
I've got another
technical term for you.

444
00:39:53,754 --> 00:39:55,934
"Non-sustainable business model."

445
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:58,301
You're focusing on the negative.

446
00:39:58,502 --> 00:40:02,149
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

447
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,233
What happens when word gets out,

448
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,499
and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

449
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,077
Once everyone
knows that Jesse Pinkman,

450
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:15,600
drug lord,
can be robbed with impunity...

451
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:17,748
Man, come on.

452
00:40:18,152 --> 00:40:20,742
You think Tuco had breakage?

453
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:25,630
I guess it's true, he did.
He broke bones.

454
00:40:26,513 --> 00:40:29,801
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

455
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:32,411
You want another grand?
Is that it?

456
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:34,973
- Not my point.
- Take it. Here.

457
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:41,793
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

458
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:44,066
We're making bank.
Shit happens.

459
00:40:44,377 --> 00:40:46,902
My guys get what they're up against,
and they're careful.

460
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,320
So am I.

461
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,477
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

462
00:40:51,602 --> 00:40:54,497
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

463
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:57,422
You've made
the division of labor very clear.

464
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,735
I mean, seriously.

465
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:04,834
What the hell do you want me to do?

466
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:35,288
Sorry.

467
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:37,182
You snuck in.

468
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,913
Didn't even know you were home.

469
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:42,485
What you eating?

470
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,669
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

471
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,588
I thought we nixed those, huh?

472
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Did we?

473
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:55,358
Yeah. I mean, aren't those
the ones with the off-the-chart sodium?

474
00:41:56,953 --> 00:41:58,347
I had a craving.

475
00:41:58,997 --> 00:42:01,101
Once in a while is no big deal.

476
00:42:07,374 --> 00:42:08,774
So where's Junior?

477
00:42:09,871 --> 00:42:10,663
Out.

478
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:13,797
With whom?

479
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:15,824
Louis.

480
00:42:20,383 --> 00:42:21,887
Out where?

481
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:25,581
Somewhere. I don't know.

482
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:28,170
He'll be back by 9:00.

483
00:42:31,874 --> 00:42:35,174
I just thought you might have
a clue where your son is.

484
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:36,966
Why don't you?

485
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:42,141
Why am I the only one
who needs to keep track of our son?

486
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,479
I'll tell you what, Walt.
You want to know where he is, ask him.

487
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,814
Just pick up the phone like I do.

488
00:43:04,473 --> 00:43:07,467
Perhaps you might know something...

489
00:43:08,097 --> 00:43:09,147
about this.

490
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:14,188
Perhaps.

491
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:17,302
And then again,

492
00:43:18,192 --> 00:43:19,492
perhaps I don't,

493
00:43:20,688 --> 00:43:23,188
Perhaps
I smoked them in a fugue state.

494
00:43:27,297 --> 00:43:28,781
I'd like an explanation.

495
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,974
- You really don't want to go down...
- Why would you do this?

496
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:34,890
- You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
- Three and a half cigarettes

497
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:37,280
is not going to do
a thing to the baby.

498
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,658
- Not a thing.
- I'm glad you're so sure, Doctor.

499
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,499
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

500
00:43:42,624 --> 00:43:45,545
And I'm sure you'll be
very glad to hear that, yes,

501
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,639
I feel ashamed.

502
00:43:52,057 --> 00:43:53,807
This is something that...

503
00:43:54,753 --> 00:43:57,579
- This is so unlike you.
- Oh, really?

504
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,660
How would you know?

505
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,326
Jesus.

506
00:45:49,286 --> 00:45:51,809
You had asked me
what I want you to do.

507
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,520
I want you to handle it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
