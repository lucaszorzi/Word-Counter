00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,661
<i>Last season on
AMC's Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:03,869
You're a drug dealer.

3
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:05,623
I'm a manufacturer.
I'm not a dealer.

4
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,058
Grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

5
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:10,799
- You're my new lab assistant.
- Gale Boetticher.

6
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:13,628
They're assassins. I believe
I was their prime target.

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,129
They were steered away
from me to my brother in law.

8
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:20,092
- It's tens of thousands of dollars.
- We have the money.

9
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:22,796
- You are not in this.
- How I am not in this?

10
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,624
I was wondering how soon you might
be able to take over the lab yourself.

11
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:28,331
It comes down to
you and me versus him.

12
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:30,080
I'm sorry, but
it's gonna be him.

13
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:31,743
They got me in the laundry
and they're going to kill me.

14
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:32,837
Do it!

15
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,356
Just what the hell was that?

16
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:36,754
You might wanna hold off.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,920
Why?

18
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:39,912
Because your boss
is gonna need me.

19
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:30,276
How's it coming?

20
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,681
Very, very well.

21
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:36,853
It's a flurry of deliveries.

22
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:39,191
Feels like Christmas morning.

23
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:42,395
Ah, it's exciting.

24
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:44,901
It's really coming together.

25
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:46,604
And I would like to point out...

26
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:49,576
...that if you have any
very understandable questions...

27
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,112
...about the price tag...

28
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:56,421
That sound-- Quality.

29
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:58,358
At Pfizer, at Merck...

30
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:00,962
...that unit would be
right at home.

31
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,865
That goes for all of it.

32
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:05,636
Good.

33
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,472
I want you to have
what you need.

34
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:12,013
Oh. Well, I doff
my proverbial cap to you, sir.

35
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:15,016
When do you think
we'll be up and running?

36
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,286
Within a month, I'd say.

37
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:18,623
Two weeks.

38
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:24,335
Yeah, two weeks.

39
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,504
Good. Very good.

40
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,772
By the way...

41
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:30,344
...that sample
you asked me to run...

42
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:34,818
...I ran it, and it is quite good.

43
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:36,321
Thank you very much, Gale.

44
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:37,857
You can give that
to Victor to discard.

45
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,593
Sure.

46
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,096
Is that our competition?

47
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,465
I'm sorry?

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,101
The...

49
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:47,538
It really is quite good.

50
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:49,307
The purity, of course,
I'm speaking of...

51
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:51,745
...speaking strictly
in chemical terms.

52
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:54,715
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue color...

53
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,791
...but... If that
is our competition...

54
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:02,061
...we have our work
cut out for us...

55
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,864
...so to speak.

56
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:05,667
You don't have
any competition, Gale...

57
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:07,437
...not as far as I'm concerned.

58
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:10,675
After all,
how pure can pure be?

59
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,050
Well, it can be
pretty darn pure.

60
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:19,757
Mr. Fring,
I can guarantee you...

61
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,596
...a purity of 96%.
I'm proud of that figure.

62
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:26,034
It's a hard-earned
figure, 96.

63
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,774
However, this other
product is 99...

64
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:33,279
...maybe even a touch beyond that.

65
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:36,918
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph...

66
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:39,622
...to say for sure, but...

67
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:44,062
...that last 3%, it may
not sound like a lot...

68
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:46,232
...but it is.

69
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,369
It's tremendous.

70
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:51,974
It's a tremendous gulf.

71
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:54,444
Gale, for our purposes...

72
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,017
...96% will do just fine.

73
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:01,156
Please, don't let this
trouble you.

74
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:05,229
Yeah. It's just...

75
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:08,269
I'd love to know
who synthesized it...

76
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:09,738
...is all.

77
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:14,545
A man who wants
to work with me.

78
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,748
A trained chemist,
like yourself.

79
00:04:16,783 --> 00:04:19,386
But it won't happen.

80
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,856
I don't consider him
a professional.

81
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:28,498
If he's not, I don't know
what that makes me.

82
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,069
I'm not trying to talk
myself out of a job.

83
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,674
With this person,
there are other considerations.

84
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:39,516
His is the best I've
ever seen, hands down.

85
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:44,858
And I look at this
place that you've built...

86
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:47,062
...the money you're investing...

87
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:49,734
...sparing no expense.

88
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:51,771
And I know--

89
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,847
I know that you want the best.

90
00:05:57,021 --> 00:05:58,992
6353 Juan Tabo.

91
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,427
Apartment 6.

92
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:03,399
No, no. Eubank's west.

93
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,903
It's between Eubank and Spain...

94
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:07,141
...but Mazatlan's closest.

95
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:10,081
I don't know.
I just heard the one...

96
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:12,352
...just the one single, like,
you know, like a backfire...

97
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:13,788
...like a truck backfiring.

98
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:15,158
I came out of my apartment--

99
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:16,827
A couple of us came out.

100
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:18,264
No. No, nobody saw it.

101
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:21,068
Did you guys see anybody?

102
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:22,438
Guys, did you?

103
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:24,607
I don't know if they
speak English too good.

104
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:25,677
They're just
shaking their heads.

105
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:26,978
I don't think they saw anybody.

106
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,248
It was just this one loud--

107
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:30,753
This-- This very loud pop,
and that was all.

108
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,890
No arguing or like that.

109
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,463
So you guys good
in directions there?

110
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:37,765
You want me to--

111
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:41,707
They coming east or west?

112
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:43,176
If they're heading east...

113
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:46,317
...tell them there's an Exxon
on their left-hand side.

114
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:48,187
Then it's straight residential.

115
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:49,991
You want me to what? Yeah.

116
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,096
No. I'll stay on the line.

117
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:58,575
You know him?

118
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:00,246
We all heard this shot.

119
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,316
Hey, I don't think
you ought to go in there.

120
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,652
Mister, this is a crime scene.

121
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:06,456
You don't want
to touch anything.

122
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,759
Mister--

123
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,699
Mister, are you
listening to me?

124
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,070
You little bastard.

125
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:35,211
Drive.

126
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:37,816
Drive!

127
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,300
What the hell happened?

128
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:17,273
He's gone?

129
00:09:18,844 --> 00:09:20,614
Look at me.

130
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:22,417
Gone?

131
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:23,786
You sure?

132
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:25,255
Gone?

133
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,327
Splattered all over.

134
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,531
Oh, Jesus.

135
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:32,669
Oh, shit.

136
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,376
All right.

137
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,014
So...

138
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:40,184
Shit.

139
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:42,822
All right, you do a sweep?

140
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:44,726
I couldn't.
People there.

141
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,466
People?

142
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,037
He get himself seen
by these people?

143
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:51,373
What about you?

144
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:55,782
What about you?

145
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:58,254
Yeah. So what?

146
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:01,794
Just another looky-loo.

147
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:16,422
I guess I'd better
get this over with.

148
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:46,079
Hey.

149
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,918
Oh, geez,
I-- I-- I woke you up.

150
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,553
- I woke you up.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

151
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:52,958
I needed to get up anyway.

152
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:54,529
Are you coming in?

153
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:57,167
No, no. It's kind of my
only time to run errands.

154
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:58,803
I just needed to--

155
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:02,477
I--

156
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:05,350
Sorry.

157
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:07,855
It's okay.

158
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:12,364
And thank you,
big time, as always.

159
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:17,440
They seem to be getting
bigger instead of smaller...

160
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:20,913
...and I'm not really sure
what that's all about.

161
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,285
Please, for God's sake...

162
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:26,224
...tell me if this is getting
to be too much for you guys.

163
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:27,559
Absolutely not, okay?

164
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:28,962
It's absolutely fine.

165
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:30,197
Okay.

166
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:37,745
Does this mean
what I think it means?

167
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:40,251
What?

168
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:41,922
You and Walt?

169
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:44,260
What?

170
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:46,129
His car's
parked in the driveway.

171
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,399
It's not a state secret.

172
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:50,305
I-- All right.
Okay. I'm not pressing.

173
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,174
I just--

174
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,978
I think that it's great.

175
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,150
That's all, all right?

176
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:57,887
- I'm out of here.
- Okay.

177
00:11:57,922 --> 00:11:59,155
Oh, hey.

178
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:02,829
A big howdy-do
to Mr. I'm-Not-Here.

179
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:33,760
Oh. Hey.

180
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:34,997
Breakfast?

181
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:36,399
Yeah.

182
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:37,568
Yeah? Okay.

183
00:14:44,181 --> 00:14:46,318
All right.
What do you want?

184
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:12,368
All right, look.

185
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:15,674
So I make it 10 to 9,
which means--

186
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,613
Shut up.

187
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,189
Which means we need...

188
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,227
...to start a cook
in the next 10 minutes...

189
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:27,097
...to keep
to our schedule--

190
00:15:27,131 --> 00:15:29,701
Gus' schedule.

191
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,443
And as angry as he may be...

192
00:15:33,478 --> 00:15:34,746
...I don't believe he's willing...

193
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,816
...to forfeit an entire batch.

194
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:39,021
That just might
make him angrier.

195
00:15:42,394 --> 00:15:45,033
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

196
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:48,138
Isn't that what this
whole thing is about?

197
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:02,083
That's right, genius.
Watch me.

198
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:04,454
We ain't missing no cook.

199
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:30,073
We're closed!

200
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:33,075
Closed!

201
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:14,552
Saul Goodman and Associates.

202
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:17,155
I'll see if he's in.
Please hold.

203
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:22,261
Saul, Skyler White calling.

204
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:26,299
Saul.

205
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:43,816
Saul, Skyler White on the line.

206
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,684
Saul!

207
00:18:45,718 --> 00:18:46,953
Hey.

208
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:49,256
Skyler White.

209
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,691
What the hell does she want?

210
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:00,767
He's nowhere
to be found.

211
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:01,936
I called his condo.

212
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,604
I called every number
I have for him.

213
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:05,005
<i>Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.</i>

214
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,874
You're sure?

215
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:09,543
As in you know where he is?

216
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:11,345
Well, I'm not the man's keeper...

217
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:13,213
...but Walt's a big boy.

218
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:14,614
He'll turn up.

219
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:16,350
<i>Mr. Goodman, clearly
something is going on here.</i>

220
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:19,185
I mean, why would he leave
his car in my driveway?

221
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,720
People carpool to work, right?

222
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:22,622
It's good for the environment.

223
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:23,790
<i>He carpools?</i>

224
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:26,459
He carpools to his job
at a meth lab?

225
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:29,362
Hey, whoa! Ho ho!
You're breaking up there.

226
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:32,099
I didn't quite catch
that last-- Whoo!

227
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,501
<i>You're a chatty Cathy today.</i>

228
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:35,469
Okay, do you know anything?

229
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,204
Anything at all?

230
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,240
I'm looking for some help here.

231
00:19:39,274 --> 00:19:41,843
Look, Walter is fine, okay?

232
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:44,780
I guarantee that 100%.

233
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:48,216
100%.

234
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:54,956
You got a passport, right?

235
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,170
Yeah. Albuquerque.

236
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,540
I'm in Nob Hill.

237
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,443
I need the number
for a locksmith.

238
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,946
I don't know. Pick one.

239
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:48,181
You sure there's nothing?

240
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:49,616
No, it's not even me.

241
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,918
It's state law, really.

242
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,920
Are you sure there isn't
some sort of...

243
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:54,954
...I don't know...

244
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:57,191
No. Nothing.

245
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,826
Maybe a car registration.

246
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,994
That would have your address.

247
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:01,862
No, but I can't even
get in my car.

248
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:03,298
My car keys
were on the same ring.

249
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,667
My God, my-- My--
My credit cards...

250
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:08,135
...my-- It's all right,
sweetheart.

251
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,138
My driver's license,
my checkbook.

252
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,973
I have to start
canceling all that--

253
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,441
My whole life
was in that purse...

254
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:16,277
...and he just came, and he cut
it right off my shoulder.

255
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,212
We could have been stabbed.

256
00:21:18,247 --> 00:21:19,747
I'm sorry, really.

257
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:22,383
But without
proof of residency--

258
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,620
I can take you down to my shop.

259
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:25,854
You're welcome to wait there...

260
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:27,089
...file a police report.

261
00:21:27,123 --> 00:21:28,791
I can't believe this.

262
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:30,592
I cannot believe this day.

263
00:21:30,627 --> 00:21:32,127
I know. It's just...

264
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:33,529
...the law.

265
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:35,397
Oh, my God.

266
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:37,466
My identification.
I-- It's gone.

267
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:43,006
Oh, God, not--
Not this second.

268
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,241
Call the pharmacy. I--

269
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:46,009
Are you okay?

270
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,111
Please, just--
Please, just take her.

271
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:49,646
Just take her, please.

272
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:53,317
Oh, God.

273
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:54,651
Not now.

274
00:21:56,654 --> 00:21:59,223
No. No. No.

275
00:22:04,796 --> 00:22:08,100
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
Truly.

276
00:22:08,134 --> 00:22:09,468
Here you go, sweetheart.

277
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,236
Oh, there you go.

278
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,742
How do you...

279
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:18,611
...how do you want to deal
with the bill?

280
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:23,016
I-- Unfortunately, all
my cash was taken, so--

281
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,585
That's fine.
We'll mail it to you.

282
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:27,655
Will you? You do know
where I live, right?

283
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:30,658
Sir, again, thank you so much.

284
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:31,993
- Really.
- Yeah.

285
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,045
Hey, there! I'm back!

286
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,788
How was P.T.?

287
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:36,162
I heard it was very good.

288
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:37,296
Yeah.

289
00:24:37,331 --> 00:24:40,567
I'm really liking
this new therapist.

290
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:42,168
He keeps me in the loop...

291
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:43,703
...always has time
for a phone call.

292
00:24:43,738 --> 00:24:45,706
I just-- I like it.

293
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:49,443
So...

294
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:51,846
...tell me all about it.

295
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:54,415
I heard you broke
new ground today.

296
00:24:56,485 --> 00:24:58,120
I broke new ground?

297
00:24:58,155 --> 00:24:59,755
That's what he said.

298
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,823
Tell me.

299
00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:08,130
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes...

300
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:12,067
...which is up
from my 15 1/2 yesterday.

301
00:25:12,102 --> 00:25:14,271
And I had maybe this much
less shit in my pants...

302
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:15,639
...so yeah, Marie, if you and him...

303
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:18,375
...and everybody else in America
secretly took a vote...

304
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:21,846
...and changed the meaning of
the entire English language...

305
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,548
...yeah, I guess
I broke new ground.

306
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:28,721
Well, call it
a figure of speech...

307
00:25:28,756 --> 00:25:32,726
...but I am seeing progress.

308
00:25:36,131 --> 00:25:37,932
Definite progress.

309
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:41,636
You're ordering a new rock?

310
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:44,906
I'm bidding on a new mineral.

311
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:48,509
It's a nice one.

312
00:25:53,181 --> 00:25:54,681
What? It's pretty.

313
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,251
I need the thing.

314
00:25:57,285 --> 00:25:58,952
Okay.

315
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:00,887
<i>Numero uno?</i>

316
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:02,355
<i>Dos.</i>

317
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,201
Okay.

318
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:40,027
Those--

319
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:43,331
Those pretty little crystals.
I like that.

320
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,201
Okay.

321
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,930
All right, I just
want to go on record...

322
00:27:09,964 --> 00:27:12,165
...we should all be wearing masks.

323
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,305
We should be wearing masks.

324
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:30,145
Mmm.

325
00:27:38,554 --> 00:27:40,588
I bet he forgets the aluminum.

326
00:27:43,925 --> 00:27:46,527
Guaranteed.

327
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,728
Guarantee he forgets.

328
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:54,199
Uh-huh.

329
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:55,666
Oh, you don't know...

330
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,401
...what the hell you're
doing, do you?

331
00:27:57,435 --> 00:27:59,602
You forgot the aluminum.

332
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:05,440
One of the first steps
in the--

333
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:13,180
Son of a bitch.

334
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,535
All right, let's talk
about Gale Boetticher.

335
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,804
He was a good man
and a good chemist...

336
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,172
...and I cared about him.

337
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:14,443
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

338
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:16,411
He didn't deserve it at all.

339
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:21,782
But I'd shoot him
again tomorrow...

340
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:25,085
...and the next day
and the day after that.

341
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,053
When you make it Gale versus me...

342
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:30,088
...or Gale versus Jesse...

343
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:33,190
...Gale loses, simple as that.

344
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:40,060
This is on you, Gus--

345
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:41,428
Not me, not Jesse.

346
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:43,729
Gale's death is on you.

347
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,100
I mean, really, what did
you expect me to do...

348
00:30:49,135 --> 00:30:51,169
...just simply roll over...

349
00:30:51,204 --> 00:30:53,437
...and allow you to murder us?

350
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:55,872
That I wouldn't
take measures--

351
00:30:55,907 --> 00:30:58,342
Extreme measures
to defend myself?

352
00:30:58,376 --> 00:30:59,410
Wrong!

353
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:02,246
Think again.

354
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,614
And whatever--

355
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:05,916
Whatever it is
you're planning there...

356
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,951
...whatever--
Whatever it is--

357
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:09,585
The point that you're
trying to make here...

358
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,789
...let me-- Let me suggest that
you keep one thing in mind.

359
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:15,759
Without us...

360
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:17,760
...without Jesse and myself...

361
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:21,931
...you have no one
to make your product.

362
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:26,067
Certainly not him.

363
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,768
This-- This person
doesn't know...

364
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:28,935
...what the hell he's doing!

365
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,137
Been watching him for weeks.

366
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:32,972
I know every step of his cook.

367
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:37,609
Do you really? You--

368
00:31:42,746 --> 00:31:46,816
Really? So please tell me.

369
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,652
Catalytic hydrogenation...

370
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:51,553
...is it protic or aprotic?
Because I forget.

371
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:54,155
And if our reduction
is not stereospecific...

372
00:31:54,189 --> 00:31:57,458
...then how can our product
be enantiomerically pure?

373
00:31:57,492 --> 00:32:00,660
I mean,
is 1 phenyl, 1 hydroxyl...

374
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:02,228
...2 methylaminopropane...

375
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:05,197
...containing, of course,
chiral centers...

376
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:07,666
...at carbons number 1 and 2
on the propane chain?

377
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,067
Then reduction
to methamphetamine...

378
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:13,571
...eliminates which
chiral center is it again?

379
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:15,905
Because I forgot.

380
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,608
Come on, help me out,
professor!

381
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:20,843
Gus.

382
00:32:21,845 --> 00:32:23,377
We're here. Come on.

383
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:25,647
Let us work.

384
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:29,683
All his bullshit aside,
it's called a cook.

385
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:32,051
See, everything comes down
to following a recipe.

386
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:34,719
Simple, complicated,
it doesn't matter.

387
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:37,155
The steps never change...

388
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:40,257
...and I know every step.

389
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,526
Oh, is--
Is that what you want?

390
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:46,329
This-- This...
short order cook?

391
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:48,863
You're not flipping
hamburgers here, pal.

392
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:51,065
What happens when you get a
bad barrel of precursor?

393
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:52,800
Or how would you even know it?

394
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:54,569
And what happens in the summer...

395
00:32:54,603 --> 00:32:57,070
...when-- When-- When
the humidity rises...

396
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,371
...and your product goes cloudy?

397
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:02,707
How would you
guard against that?

398
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:04,842
Gus.

399
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:08,411
You do this...

400
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,446
...all you'll have left...

401
00:33:10,481 --> 00:33:13,716
...is an $8 million
hole in the ground.

402
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,084
This lab--

403
00:33:16,252 --> 00:33:18,586
This equipment is
useless without us.

404
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,954
Without-- Without
Jesse and myself...

405
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:23,089
...you have no new product.

406
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:25,024
You-- You--
You have no income.

407
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:27,159
Your people out there
will not be paid.

408
00:33:27,193 --> 00:33:29,660
Your distribution chain
collapses.

409
00:33:29,695 --> 00:33:31,628
Without us...

410
00:33:31,663 --> 00:33:33,562
...you have nothing.

411
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,733
You kill me, you have nothing.

412
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,068
You kill Jesse,
you don't have me.

413
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:58,282
You won't do this.

414
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:01,084
You're too smart.

415
00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:04,355
You can't afford to do this.

416
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:06,822
Please.

417
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:11,792
Let us just go back to work.

418
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:13,293
We're here.

419
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:15,628
Let us work.
We're-- We're--

420
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,529
We're ready to go to work.

421
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:21,198
We'll just pick up
right where we left off.

422
00:34:40,783 --> 00:34:42,416
Oh, my God.

423
00:37:53,596 --> 00:37:54,596
Well?

424
00:37:57,098 --> 00:37:58,832
Get back to work.

425
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:59,277
Let's just--
We'll just lay this down.

426
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:01,680
We'll put him in feet first.

427
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,448
Grab his shoe.

428
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:06,250
Oh. Here. Wait, wait.
Just life him up.

429
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:08,352
There. All right.

430
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,387
Here we go.

431
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:14,358
God.

432
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:16,427
If you push that way,
I'll hold him in.

433
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:20,197
Okay, ready?

434
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:22,232
1--

435
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:23,533
Oh, shit!

436
00:39:25,203 --> 00:39:27,004
All right, wait. Wait.

437
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:30,808
Forget that.

438
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:41,586
Come on.

439
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:42,621
Up!

440
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,727
Get down.

441
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:52,096
Okay.

442
00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:10,147
I never used this stuff.
You sure it'll do the job?

443
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:12,582
Trust us.

444
00:41:41,704 --> 00:41:44,338
Here you go, hon.
Get you anything else?

445
00:41:44,372 --> 00:41:45,840
No, I'm good.
Thanks.

446
00:41:52,314 --> 00:41:53,581
God.

447
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:16,467
How are you doing?

448
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,271
No, I mean, you know--

449
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,375
How are you doing?

450
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,484
You did the only thing
that you could.

451
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,420
I hope you understand that.

452
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:42,223
Thoughts?

453
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:47,396
Got any thoughts...

454
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,565
...on what our next move might be?

455
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:52,634
What next move?

456
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:54,302
Our next move.

457
00:42:54,336 --> 00:42:56,604
Our next move...

458
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,007
...given the fact that
at the first opportunity...

459
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:00,776
...Gus will kill us.

460
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,113
What, that wasn't
an opportunity just now?

461
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:06,982
Seemed like a pretty damn
good opportunity to me.

462
00:43:07,016 --> 00:43:08,951
- No, no.
- Golden, I would say.

463
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:10,652
We bought ourselves some time.

464
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:12,286
- Uh-uh.
- Yes, but--

465
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:15,689
The question is how much.

466
00:43:15,723 --> 00:43:17,791
He'll be looking
for another chemist.

467
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:19,926
He's not going to find
another chemist.

468
00:43:19,961 --> 00:43:21,027
Hmm.

469
00:43:21,062 --> 00:43:23,463
Where is he going to find
another chemist?

470
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:25,732
It's not just about somebody...

471
00:43:25,766 --> 00:43:27,867
...being able
to run a lab that big.

472
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:29,635
Someone he can trust...

473
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:32,839
...someone he knows will
keep their mouths shut.

474
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:36,709
Yeah. Good luck with that.

475
00:43:38,746 --> 00:43:41,981
Bet it took him years
to find Gale.

476
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:45,118
Bet he's sorry now.

477
00:43:54,427 --> 00:43:55,627
Are you sure you're okay?

478
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:57,895
At least now we all
understand each other.

479
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:00,264
Right?

480
00:44:00,298 --> 00:44:01,332
What do you mean?

481
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:05,168
I mean him and us, we get it.

482
00:44:12,144 --> 00:44:14,379
We're all on the same page.

483
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:20,585
What page is that?

484
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:23,255
The one that says...

485
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:25,257
"If I can't kill you..."

486
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:28,160
"...you'll sure as shit
wish you were dead."

487
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:41,772
Yo. Excuse me.

488
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,375
Thanks.

489
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:00,589
Here.

490
00:45:02,926 --> 00:45:04,026
Thanks.

491
00:45:23,715 --> 00:45:24,849
Hi.

492
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,919
Hi.

493
00:45:30,822 --> 00:45:33,291
It's-- It's parked
over on Amsden.

494
00:45:33,325 --> 00:45:34,893
Junior was about to get up...

495
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:36,661
...and he would have seen it...

496
00:45:36,696 --> 00:45:39,265
...so I wanted to avoid
a lot of questions.

497
00:45:40,734 --> 00:45:42,668
That was smart.

498
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:44,471
Yeah.

499
00:45:46,974 --> 00:45:47,974
Kenny Rogers.

500
00:45:54,247 --> 00:45:55,714
You okay?

501
00:45:57,616 --> 00:45:58,950
Yeah.

502
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:01,352
Right as rain.

503
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:10,494
Do you have your keys?

504
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:12,029
Yeah.

505
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:15,066
It's parked
three blocks down...

506
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,467
...on the right.

507
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:20,205
Yeah.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
