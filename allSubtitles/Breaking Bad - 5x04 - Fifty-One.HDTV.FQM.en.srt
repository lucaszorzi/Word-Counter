1
00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:02,843
Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:03,999
Are you moving back in?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,174
Yes.

4
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:08,272
Do you really think
that's... that's a good idea?

5
00:00:08,386 --> 00:00:10,287
A list of names.
They trace back to Madrigal

6
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,733
and they're gonna get
picked up by the police.

7
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,110
Outstanding work, Hank.
If only we had listened.

8
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:15,781
It's not right to put
this on you.

9
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,060
Shut up! Shut up!

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,889
Breakdown?
What does that mean?

11
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,940
It means I don't know
what else to call it.

12
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:23,486
You do know, right?

13
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:25,130
She was having an affair.

14
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:27,656
Can you still get your
hands on methylamine?

15
00:00:27,793 --> 00:00:29,652
Maybe.
Why?

16
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:32,912
I gotta say,
when you first brought her in,

17
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,446
I had my doubts.

18
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:37,949
But your little darling's
got nine lives.

19
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:45,023
Rear-wheel assembly took the
brunt of the impact, so, uh...

20
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:46,424
Yeah.

21
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,227
CV shaft, boots,
joints, axle--

22
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,594
Replaced all of it.
No way around it.

23
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,497
I went after market
on most of the parts here.

24
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:57,134
You want me to swap in
factory parts, that's fine.

25
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:59,869
But using after-market's the only
way we'll keep it under blue book

26
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,140
and on the insurance company's
dime, okay?

27
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:05,142
Nothing beats free.

28
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:07,743
Uh, swapped out
your air filter,

29
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:10,246
topped off your fluids.

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,699
Didn't have to replace
the windshield this time.

31
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:14,159
I know, right?

32
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:16,285
Oh, and I noticed you had

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,487
some sort of gunky buildup

34
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,489
in the front end here.

35
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:23,291
First, I had no idea
what I was looking at.

36
00:01:23,326 --> 00:01:25,093
Then I remembered
that you had me replace

37
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,177
that front fender
a few months back

38
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:29,027
when you ran over that deer.

39
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,466
We went at it
with the steam hose,

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,301
cleaned it up for you.

41
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:36,637
Hardest part was the paint.

42
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:39,506
Fern green.
Interesting tint.

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,241
Anything else?

44
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:44,378
That's it.
Zero balance, like I said.

45
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:47,448
Sign here, you're good to go.

46
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,517
People like to joke,

47
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:56,089
but I really, really like this car.
She's * hell.

48
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:59,492
I'm betting you get another
200,000 miles out of her.

49
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:23,348
Hey, Benny.

50
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,750
What would you give me for it?

51
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:28,486
What's the blue book, you mean?

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,523
No. I mean, what will
you pay me for this car?

53
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,192
Well, I'm not
really looking for--

54
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:37,561
$100?

55
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,163
Fifty?

56
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:42,065
Insurance company just shelled
out 1,900 for the parts alone.

57
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,067
Then it's a bargain.

58
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:47,470
You give me 50 bucks,
and she's all yours.

59
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:49,372
You sure about this?

60
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:50,740
Sure as shooting.

61
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:53,910
I'll check the register.

62
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:55,545
Dad?

63
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:59,048
Fifty bucks?
Are you crazy?

64
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:24,128
Sync and corrections by n17t01

65
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:55,223
Gotta be kidding me.

66
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,780
Oh, Christ.

67
00:05:26,145 --> 00:05:27,665
I'm at work right now.

68
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,355
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

69
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:31,457
<i>This is a heads-up.</i>
<i>You got visitors.</i>

70
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:35,060
Visitors? What--
You mean today?

71
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,729
<i>I mean 30 seconds.</i>

72
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:44,302
Come in.

73
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,906
Ms. Rodarte-Quayle?

74
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,835
Agent Hank Schrader,
Agent Steve Gomez, DEA.

75
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:56,533
We met briefly in Albuquerque.

76
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:58,282
Uh, yes, we did.

77
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,484
What can I do for you?

78
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,445
Navy plants,
powder-blue shirt.

79
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,034
Hey, buddy.

80
00:07:25,097 --> 00:07:26,730
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- They got Ron.

81
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:29,800
- Ron's done.
<i>- Okay.</i>

82
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,869
No. No.

83
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:34,038
Not okay, Mike.

84
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:36,107
Not okay. The--

85
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:37,942
The look he just gave me

86
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:41,478
was the very antithesis
of "okay," okay?

87
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,879
<i>Breathe, Lydia.</i>

88
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:45,272
<i>No one's talking to the police.</i>

89
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:48,223
I just had like 14 DEA agents

90
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,988
barge into my office,
screaming and yelling at me,

91
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:54,291
and they were swarming
all over the warehouse, okay?

92
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:55,792
The warehouse!

93
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:58,194
Besides, Ron was my guy.

94
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,129
Remember?
I don't have a guy anymore.

95
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:02,588
Ron fixed security and pulled
the barrels and drove the truck.

96
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,367
You can't expect me
to do that stuff.

97
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,869
I mean, let's be realistic.

98
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:15,743
- Mike, this is crazy.
- I'll send a new guy.

99
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,937
Are you crazy?

100
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,671
My car almost has
500 horsepower.

101
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,508
- It would totally smoke.
- Horsepower isn't everything.

102
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,009
Don't you know that?

103
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:54,347
You have to factor in drag
and torque and suspension

104
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:56,349
and weight of the car.

105
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,784
And listen, one more factor that
you're not thinking about--

106
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:00,452
The experience of the driver.

107
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,254
- And I totally got you there.
- Please. Please.

108
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,722
- I got you.
- You drive like a geezer.

109
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,558
Really?
I drive like a gee--

110
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:09,294
Tell me, can a geezer do donuts?
I don't think so.

111
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,000
Bullshit you ever did donuts.

112
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:12,463
Whoa.
Watch your language.

113
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:13,797
- And, yes, I did.
- Seriously?

114
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,799
Yes, seriously.
And if you show me

115
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,235
just a modicum of respect,
maybe I'll teach you.

116
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,571
- Yeah? Yes?
- No.

117
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:22,639
- No, I won't. I take that back.
- Yes. Yes. No--

118
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,808
- Just a joke. I'm just--
- You're saying yes.

119
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:26,209
No! No, no.
That was kidding.

120
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:28,378
- We didn't shake on it. No.
- Yes. Yes.

121
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:29,979
- We are now.
- That doesn't count!

122
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:33,983
I know you don't approve.

123
00:09:36,153 --> 00:09:41,691
But mine... we'll call it a
birthday present to myself.

124
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:43,725
And Junior's...

125
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,928
People will just chalk that up

126
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:49,498
as me being a softy.

127
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,969
And besides...

128
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,738
I didn't actually buy
either one.

129
00:09:56,772 --> 00:10:00,641
They're both leases.
So it all fits our story.

130
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:02,643
Okay?

131
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,313
Oh.

132
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:18,525
We can afford it now.
Hmm?

133
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,929
You're back at it.

134
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,165
Well, yeah.

135
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:29,269
We have to make up
that 600,000 we lost.

136
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,449
What do you think
about boarding school?

137
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,451
Boarding school?

138
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:48,753
For who--
For Junior?

139
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:51,356
There's this place
in northern Arizona,

140
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,358
and it's supposed to be

141
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:55,726
one of the top ten
in the country.

142
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:59,297
He's a year away from college.

143
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:02,799
Why on earth would we do that?

144
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:05,902
I don't know.
I just...

145
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:08,205
Just thinking about the kids.

146
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:11,074
Mmm. Holly, too?

147
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,710
Where are we sending
our eight-month-old?

148
00:11:13,744 --> 00:11:17,414
Peace corps?

149
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,448
No. I just...

150
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:24,153
A new environment

151
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,422
might be good for them.

152
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,457
What does that mean?

153
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,076
What's wrong with
their environment?

154
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:37,165
Skyler...

155
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:42,204
What's wrong
with their environment?

156
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:46,808
Nothing.

157
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:55,249
Hey.

158
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,000
Listen, I know these
last few weeks

159
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:02,089
have been rough.

160
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:03,757
The threat to Hank

161
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,559
and this whole thing
with Beneke.

162
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:10,563
But there's absolutely nothing

163
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:13,266
for you to be afraid of
anymore, okay?

164
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,268
I mean, clear sailing
from here on out.

165
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,169
I promise.

166
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,507
You know, I want us to try

167
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,610
and start looking forward
to things again.

168
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,580
Speaking of which, my birthday.

169
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,115
Hmm?

170
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,617
I don't know--

171
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,619
I don't know
what you have planned,

172
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,556
and with everything
that's been going on lately,

173
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,990
I'd understand if you haven't
even given it a thought.

174
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:43,000
But I think

175
00:12:43,194 --> 00:12:46,163
a little celebration
might be good.

176
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,399
For all of us.

177
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:52,770
You know, a birthday party.

178
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:56,172
What do you think?

179
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,976
Yeah?

180
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,578
Okay.

181
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,748
And maybe, if I may be so bold,

182
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,241
chocolate cake
with chocolate icing?

183
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:15,824
Life is good, Skyler.

184
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:19,961
Ohh...

185
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:34,035
Mmm. Thank you.

186
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:36,250
Hey, mom, you forgot something.

187
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,680
- Hmm?
- Dad's bacon.

188
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,582
That's okay.
I can do it.

189
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:42,617
No. Mom has to.

190
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:48,223
Well, it is
sort of a tradition.

191
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:54,895
Watch this, Holly.

192
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,330
Watch what she does with bacon.

193
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:59,800
Watch it. Watch it.

194
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:02,603
What is she doing?

195
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:05,939
What is she doing?
Hmm?

196
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:11,778
That's a pretty small "1."

197
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:13,780
Kind of is.

198
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:16,783
Just a little.

199
00:14:18,386 --> 00:14:20,687
Ah, now you're talking.

200
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,155
- No. No.
- Good move.

201
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,923
- No.
- No, no, no. It's good.

202
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,925
Very good.
Family teamwork.

203
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,228
Making sacrifices.
Very important.

204
00:14:29,262 --> 00:14:31,530
- Happy birthday, dad.
- Thank you, buddy.

205
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:33,132
You want some?

206
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,468
Guy's some piece
of work, isn't he?

207
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:37,302
Six feet under
and half a face--

208
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,137
he's still screwing with us.

209
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,573
So, what's next?

210
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,641
Oh, I don't know.

211
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,010
This Madrigal thing seems
hinky, though, you know?

212
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:49,547
We got Burgermeister Meisterburger
over here in Germany,

213
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:52,283
and 5,000 miles away,
you got this guy.

214
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:54,284
There's gotta be someone
in the middle, you know?

215
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,420
Someone we're missing.

216
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:02,325
What about that, uh,
Lydia what's-her-name?

217
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,160
You know, lady banjo eyes
at the warehouse?

218
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,529
In this world?
No way.

219
00:15:06,563 --> 00:15:08,164
Too uptight.
Too together.

220
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,566
Maybe.

221
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,869
She was wearing
mismatched shoes.

222
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:15,171
How together can she be?

223
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,677
Gentlemen,
how goes it with Fring?

224
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:25,214
You know, just, uh,
working through the grief.

225
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:28,284
How soon before
you submit a final?

226
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:31,254
Well, we've been
kicking around some ideas.

227
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:33,288
Had you asked me that
a couple of weeks ago,

228
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:36,491
- I'd have said this was
just a mop-up job, but... - But?

229
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:39,161
Well, no one on Fring's crew
is talking to us.

230
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:41,396
I mean, not a peep,
no matter how hard we squeeze.

231
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,965
Which makes it likely there's somebody
out there keeping them in line.

232
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:47,569
Our money is on this guy--
Michael Ehrmantraut.

233
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:50,671
He's Fring's head
of "corporate" security.

234
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:53,674
- He's a definite hard case.
- Now, we're gonna stay on him.

235
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,177
We're putting together a
surveillance team as we speak.

236
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,312
Okay?
The other thing is--

237
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:03,284
This may be unrelated, but the blue meth
is... is making a bit of a * back.

238
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:06,452
- Tell him, Gomie. - Yeah. Some small
amounts on the street-side pulls.

239
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,521
Lab's telling us
it's the same stuff.

240
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,756
I mean, it could be
old inventory leaking out,

241
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,294
or it could be
somebody's rebooting,

242
00:16:14,328 --> 00:16:18,231
using Fring's former cooks
to set up a new operation.

243
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:19,932
I thought we had
Fring's cooks--

244
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:21,966
the unsubs in the lab fire.

245
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,969
Thought maybe one of them
was your Heisenberg.

246
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:28,340
Yeah. Maybe.
I don't know.

247
00:16:28,374 --> 00:16:31,476
Like I said,
there's still a lot of questions.

248
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:35,447
Agent Gomez,
could you give us a moment?

249
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:42,119
Hank, I gotta say,

250
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,489
your work here
has been stellar.

251
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:47,491
Really first rate.

252
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:49,327
Thank you, sir.

253
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:52,630
So much so that I'm wondering
if it's time you made a change.

254
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:55,965
You know, I have to
get back to El Paso.

255
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,568
This office needs an ASAC,

256
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:01,003
and I'm thinking we should be
promoting from within.

257
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:03,172
If you were to put in
an application,

258
00:17:03,207 --> 00:17:06,610
and I recommend that you do,
you will get the job.

259
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:08,845
I have no doubt this DO
would be well served

260
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:11,413
with you at the helm.

261
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,283
Wow. That's, uh...

262
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,353
I'm not sure what to say.

263
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:19,355
It's a big step up.

264
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,123
It's not without its headaches.

265
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:22,924
Politics may take
some getting used to.

266
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,360
Plus, you'd be overseeing
every case in the office,

267
00:17:25,394 --> 00:17:27,262
so you'd need to reassign
all your day-to-days,

268
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,796
Fring included.

269
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,733
Much as I hate losing
a good field man,

270
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,302
that's the job,
and you need to be okay with it.

271
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:37,838
What do you say, Hank?

272
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:41,142
You want it?

273
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,311
Well,

274
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:46,713
considering my wife would
murder me if I said "no"...

275
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:51,618
Yeah. I want it.

276
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,853
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

277
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,930
Can you, uh,

278
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:07,333
finish up for me?

279
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,802
It's-- it's my birthday.

280
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:12,838
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:15,340
I probably have
a birthday party

282
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:17,842
waiting for me, you know, so...

283
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:21,245
Uh, yeah. Cool.
Yeah, no problem.

284
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,548
Hey, uh, happy birthday.

285
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,484
Thanks.

286
00:18:49,506 --> 00:18:51,607
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

287
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,917
Where's your mom?

288
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:03,352
Uh, kitchen.

289
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,893
Hey.

290
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,694
Oh, hey.

291
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:19,267
So, what's the plan?

292
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:22,470
Um, Hank and Marie
are on their way,

293
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:25,506
roast chicken and potatoes
for dinner,

294
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,308
rocky road for desert,

295
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:33,248
and, uh, chocolate cake,
as requested.

296
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:48,228
What's up?

297
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:50,229
Me?

298
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:52,731
Nothing.

299
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:57,069
Thought you'd be more jazzed
about the new job.

300
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:59,238
No! What--
No! I am!

301
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:01,507
- Baby, I'm so proud of you.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, okay...

302
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,343
- Sorry, sorry.
- I believe you. Just don't kill us here.

303
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:11,116
Marie, you've been moping
around the last few days.

304
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,319
Marie?

305
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:19,090
What's up?

306
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,626
- Marie, come on.
- I'm sorry. I...

307
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:24,628
I made a promise to someone.

308
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:28,265
To who?

309
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:32,903
- Who?
- Your brother-in-law.

310
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,408
Are you gonna give me
a hint at least?

311
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:40,276
It involves infidelity.
That's all I'm gonna say.

312
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,549
Oh, shit.
I knew it.

313
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:51,087
Knew what? What did you--
What did you know?

314
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:54,689
Well, I mean, I didn't know it,
but I've been saying it forever.

315
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,925
Walt's second cell phone,
you know?

316
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,361
Sorry, babe, but I was way
ahead of you on this one.

317
00:21:01,097 --> 00:21:03,898
Way ahead of me.
Oh.

318
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:08,270
Well, it wasn't Walt.

319
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:13,374
Skyler?

320
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,113
No way.

321
00:21:24,386 --> 00:21:25,353
Hey.

322
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:28,188
- Hey! There she is!
- Hey! Hi!

323
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:30,123
- Hey!
- Hey!

324
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:32,492
- Hey, buddy. Yeah.
- Welcome. Welcome.

325
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:34,493
Happy birthday!

326
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,331
I'm in the center lane
going about 60,

327
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:41,301
and I had no choice but just
tear butt out of there.

328
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,668
Just bwaaa!
So sweet.

329
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,737
Yeah, you know, highway patrol's
gonna be sweet on it too.

330
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,672
Gonna get their ticket quota
in a month.

331
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,541
You'll help me out,
right, Uncle Hank,

332
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,543
now that you run the DEA?

333
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,779
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled brat
car wash millionaire nephew?

334
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,516
Sure. I'll make sure you get
a cell with a view.

335
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,251
All right.

336
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,087
- Well, I'm outta here.
- Okay.

337
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,156
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, buddy.

338
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,427
- Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.
- Thanks.

339
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,396
- I'll see y'all later.
- All right.

340
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,031
- All right. Have fun.
- Bye, drive safe.

341
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,125
- Drive safely, okay?
- I do.

342
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:17,467
- Slow down.
- Never.

343
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,877
A hell of a couple cars
there, Walt.

344
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:30,046
Honey, for my next birthday,

345
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,847
I'm gonna take
a page here from Walt

346
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:34,150
and buy myself a jet plane.

347
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:36,852
Well, maybe
I over did it a little.

348
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:38,787
But with these
new lease rates--

349
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:41,424
I mean,
they're mighty attractive.

350
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,300
Great dinner, Skyler.

351
00:22:52,334 --> 00:22:55,770
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes, I tell you.

352
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:58,239
You have to tell me
how you get all the lumps out.

353
00:22:58,274 --> 00:22:59,574
How do you do that?

354
00:22:59,608 --> 00:23:04,062
- A potato ricer.
- A ricer?

355
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:06,746
You don't hand mash?

356
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:09,683
No.

357
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,993
- Well, uh...
- Boy, it has...

358
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:24,029
It has been quite a year, huh?

359
00:23:24,064 --> 00:23:26,031
Do you know that, uh,

360
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:29,368
it's almost exactly a year ago

361
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:31,404
that I got my diagnosis?

362
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:33,339
- Jesus. Yeah, right?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:33,373 --> 00:23:36,308
- Seems like longer, doesn't it?
- Yeah. No. It's, uh...

364
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:39,811
One year ago tomorrow.

365
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:42,547
Day after my 50th.

366
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,947
Honestly, I never thought
I'd make it this far.

367
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:51,322
The cancer and surgery

368
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:53,957
and Hank being shot--

369
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,759
It's just...

370
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:58,229
So many dark days.

371
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:00,364
Well...

372
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:03,501
There's Marie's talking pillow.

373
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:06,369
Remember that?

374
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,070
It was...

375
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:11,274
Boy, I did not want
to get any treatment.

376
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:17,947
I think I was too scared

377
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:19,815
or too angry or...

378
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,152
I don't know.
I just wanted to quit.

379
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:28,323
But you guys--
You got me through it somehow.

380
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,326
Kept me going.

381
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:36,331
And that happened again
and again and again.

382
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:38,966
I mean, there were times

383
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,470
when I was sure I was done for.

384
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:44,872
But then someone

385
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:47,074
or something

386
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:51,512
would come through for me.

387
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:54,414
God. And Skyler--
I can't--

388
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:57,184
Honey, remember that
first week of chemotherapy?

389
00:24:57,218 --> 00:24:59,619
That night
on the bathroom floor?

390
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:01,953
What you said to me?

391
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:05,926
I was so sick.

392
00:25:05,992 --> 00:25:09,361
It was rough going at first.

393
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:11,463
But Skyler--

394
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,899
She was right there, of course,

395
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:16,868
putting wet washcloths
on my forehead.

396
00:25:16,903 --> 00:25:18,969
And she's singing to me.

397
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:22,273
And this would go on and on,

398
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:24,975
day after day.

399
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,646
And I remember I was lying
on the floor of the bathroom,

400
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:33,350
because the tile felt
nice and cool, you know?

401
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:36,353
And my head
was in Skyler's lap,

402
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:39,590
and I was just asking her

403
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:42,292
if this could all be over.

404
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:47,997
It was too hard. It was...
I just wanted it to stop.

405
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,733
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

406
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,605
Whoa. Hey-o. Pool party.

407
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:58,874
What are you doing, Skyler?

408
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:01,510
What is she doing?
Walt?

409
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:04,547
Hey, uh, Sky,
maybe it's time to get out now.

410
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:05,913
What do you think?

411
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:08,049
Skyler, Hank asked you
a question.

412
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:11,753
You need to get out n--
Skyler!

413
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:14,088
She's gonna come up, right?

414
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,539
She has to.

415
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,099
Skyler, you need to get out.

416
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,100
Oh, my God.

417
00:26:40,135 --> 00:26:42,769
Wha-- Okay.

418
00:26:42,803 --> 00:26:45,705
Okay. It's gotta be...

419
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:51,378
Nope.

420
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,214
Okay...

421
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:57,216
Come on!
How am I supposed to...

422
00:27:10,564 --> 00:27:12,330
Hey.

423
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:13,898
Wait.

424
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,901
Wait, wait.
Who are you?

425
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:19,771
I'm the-- I'm the guy.
So where's the--

426
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,773
Hold on. Hold on.

427
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,575
Who sent you?

428
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,678
Who sent me?
Who do you think?

429
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:31,382
- No. I'm asking you.
- Mike...

430
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,849
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

431
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,052
And this Mike person--

432
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,188
What's his last name?

433
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,791
Lady, I just got off a plane
from New Mexico,

434
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,560
and I got
a 900-mile drive back.

435
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,961
That's 14 hours
if I don't stop.

436
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:48,331
So, the sooner we do this,
the sooner it's done.

437
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,638
Uh, Ehrmantraut.

438
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:58,341
Okay? Satisfied?

439
00:28:02,078 --> 00:28:05,380
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
apologize for being careful.

440
00:28:05,415 --> 00:28:07,382
With all that's been happening
around here, for all I knew,

441
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,585
you were one of those undercover
people they send into high schools.

442
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:13,655
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day if
we're getting ganged by prison guards.

443
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:15,690
Oh, no doubt.

444
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,458
So, uh,
where's the--

445
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:19,994
Up there.
Number 22356.

446
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:22,130
That's the one I erased
from the inventory,

447
00:28:22,164 --> 00:28:24,165
so it has to be that one.

448
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:28,102
- Can you reach it?
- With a forklift.

449
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:29,803
You got one?

450
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,491
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Stop!

451
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:57,596
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

452
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:59,097
What?

453
00:28:59,132 --> 00:29:02,201
Please tell me that's
not what I think it is.

454
00:29:20,085 --> 00:29:22,919
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

455
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:25,489
No. No, of course not.

456
00:29:27,258 --> 00:29:29,326
No, no.

457
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,361
I just...

458
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:41,904
She and I are
having some issues.

459
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,608
Yeah, yeah. I, uh--
I might've heard

460
00:29:45,642 --> 00:29:47,643
a little bit about that.

461
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:50,913
I mean, hey, look,
Marie didn't go into detail.

462
00:29:50,947 --> 00:29:52,914
You know, said that,

463
00:29:52,948 --> 00:29:55,183
you know, you guys were...

464
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:58,119
having some issues.

465
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:04,659
So, uh, what's the next move?

466
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:07,995
It may be good to have
her talk to someone.

467
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,997
- Oh, I agree.
- Yeah.

468
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:12,866
Well, I'm gonna
get on that first thing.

469
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,201
Yeah.

470
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:16,737
There's Marie's guy, Dave.

471
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:19,906
She seems really happy
with him.

472
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:21,908
Not that Marie's
an advertisement

473
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:24,510
for advanced mental health
or anything.

474
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,313
You know...

475
00:30:27,348 --> 00:30:31,516
I just had no idea
she was taking it this hard.

476
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,989
Some birthday, huh?

477
00:30:47,932 --> 00:30:50,100
She's gonna try
and get some sleep.

478
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:52,136
Oh, okay.

479
00:30:57,876 --> 00:30:59,343
What was that?

480
00:30:59,378 --> 00:31:03,580
- I don't know.
- I mean, was she trying...?

481
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:05,782
No, not in
a swimming pool. No.

482
00:31:05,816 --> 00:31:08,418
With all of us there?
No, I don't think so.

483
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:13,055
But, uh, we both, uh,

484
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,392
think that...

485
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:18,795
she should talk to someone.

486
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:22,164
I'm gonna get you
Dave's number.

487
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:23,766
Okay.

488
00:31:26,703 --> 00:31:29,471
Listen, Walt, I--

489
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:32,073
I can't help but sense

490
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:34,476
that there may be some issues

491
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:36,444
between you and Skyler.

492
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,546
None of our business,
of course.

493
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,349
And, Hank, I don't know if you

494
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,785
- picked up on any of--
- He knows--

495
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,187
He knows I know.

496
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:56,996
These things happen
in a marriage,

497
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,612
but it isn't unfixable.

498
00:31:59,634 --> 00:32:04,504
I think what would
be great is if

499
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,640
you two had some space

500
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:11,076
to work through this stuff.

501
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,611
So--

502
00:32:12,646 --> 00:32:16,782
And keep an open mind here.

503
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:19,952
What if we took the kids
for a while?

504
00:32:20,954 --> 00:32:23,322
- Took the kids?
- Absolutely.

505
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:27,492
We'll look after them for a
day or two, or however long,

506
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:30,862
and leave you and Skyler

507
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:33,164
to look after each other.

508
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:35,633
Uh, that's very generous
of you, Marie,

509
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:40,203
but I-- I just don't see
how that's a solution.

510
00:32:40,238 --> 00:32:42,005
And-- I mean--

511
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:46,209
Besides, Junior and Holly--
That's a lot of work.

512
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:48,011
No, it isn't.

513
00:32:48,045 --> 00:32:50,013
Junior's independent,

514
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:53,450
and my niece
is only the easiest,

515
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:56,619
most delicious baby
that was ever born.

516
00:32:56,653 --> 00:32:58,788
- It'll be fun, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah.

517
00:32:58,822 --> 00:32:59,789
Yeah.

518
00:32:59,823 --> 00:33:01,791
Absolutely. Yeah.

519
00:33:01,825 --> 00:33:03,459
It's a good idea.

520
00:33:03,494 --> 00:33:05,828
I think it's a great idea.

521
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:09,832
Just the thing for both of you.

522
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:17,906
Marie,

523
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,382
this idea--

524
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:22,976
was it yours?

525
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:25,847
Actually, it was Skyler's.

526
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,519
Uh-huh.

527
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:34,288
She really needs this, Walt.

528
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,225
Yep.

529
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,436
I gave Marie bottles.

530
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,039
They'll stop and pick up
diapers on their way.

531
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,175
I spoke with Junior
on the phone,

532
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,377
and after much discussion,

533
00:33:58,412 --> 00:34:00,879
he agreed to swing by tomorrow,
pick up some clothes.

534
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:05,651
And so, voila, the kids
are out of this environment.

535
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:08,654
What a coincidence.

536
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:11,423
I know you're awake.

537
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:19,464
What was that about?
Can you explain it?

538
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:24,735
I don't want the children
here anymore.

539
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,771
It isn't safe.

540
00:34:26,805 --> 00:34:31,775
Skyler, we have talked
about this repeatedly.

541
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,777
It has never been more safe.

542
00:34:33,811 --> 00:34:35,712
"Never been"?

543
00:34:35,746 --> 00:34:38,882
A couple weeks ago,
a man was coming to this house

544
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:41,351
to kill us,
to murder your entire family.

545
00:34:41,385 --> 00:34:44,020
You were in the crawlspace,
screaming.

546
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:46,222
And I dealt with him.
It's over.

547
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:47,723
It is not.

548
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:50,092
You're right back
in the meth business again.

549
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:53,496
This is different.
Now I'm running things.

550
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,431
So wait.
Now that you're in charge,

551
00:34:56,466 --> 00:35:00,127
it's what, it's gonna be smooth
sailing from here on out?

552
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,538
I don't see why not.

553
00:35:01,573 --> 00:35:05,507
I keep the work
at work, Skyler,

554
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,942
and nothing will ever impact
you or the kids.

555
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:11,245
You don't know that.
You can't make that promise, Walt.

556
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:13,781
I can promise you
that Gus Fring is dead.

557
00:35:13,816 --> 00:35:16,183
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

558
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:18,820
I thought you were the danger.

559
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:28,896
Is that what
your pool stunt was about?

560
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,598
Trying to protect
my children from me?

561
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:33,667
Not just you...

562
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:35,868
There's blood on my hands too.

563
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:38,638
What blood? Beneke?

564
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:41,497
He's in the hospital
because of me.

565
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,782
- No.
- Because of what I did.

566
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:45,745
Skyler, you can't beat
yourself up over this thing.

567
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:48,581
Please. You didn't set out
to hurt anybody.

568
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:51,083
You made a mistake,
and things got out of control,

569
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:53,785
but you did what you had to do
to protect your family.

570
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,254
And I'm sorry.
That doesn't make you a bad person,

571
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,956
it makes you a human being.

572
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,526
Stop it, Walt.
Just stop.

573
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:04,062
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshit rationales.

574
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:05,630
I'm in it now.

575
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:08,198
I'm compromised.
But I won't--

576
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:11,168
I will not have my children
living in a house

577
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,103
where dealing drugs

578
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,505
and hurting people
and killing people

579
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,175
is shrugged off
as "shit happens."

580
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,243
We're back at it?
Fine.

581
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,001
But the kids stay away,
and that's that.

582
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,074
That's that?
That's what?

583
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:27,483
I got them out of this house.

584
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:29,819
To a sleepover
at their aunt and uncle's?

585
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:32,088
They spend a day or two,

586
00:36:32,122 --> 00:36:34,824
Junior stays up late watching
movies, and then what happens?

587
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:37,459
- We'll see.
- No, I'll tell you what happens.

588
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,249
They come home.
To this house.

589
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:41,396
To their parents who love them.

590
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,932
No. I will not let
our business endanger them.

591
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:47,569
- How many times do I have to say
that they are not in-- - I said no.

592
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:50,993
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here.

593
00:36:57,412 --> 00:37:00,247
What are you gonna do
to stop it?

594
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,625
Whatever it takes.
Everything in my power.

595
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,394
Like what? I mean, specificly.

596
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:09,957
What is your next move?

597
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:12,258
My next move
is maybe I hurt myself.

598
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:14,393
Make it clear
we need more time.

599
00:37:14,428 --> 00:37:16,963
Let Hank and Marie see
we're still struggling.

600
00:37:16,998 --> 00:37:18,598
No, more like
you're still struggling.

601
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:21,034
So maybe next time,
I have you committed.

602
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:23,670
Put you in some
inpatient facility

603
00:37:23,704 --> 00:37:25,505
while I take care
of the kids myself.

604
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:27,507
Is that what you want?

605
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:31,076
So then maybe I show up
with bruises on my neck,

606
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:33,078
give myself a black eye,

607
00:37:33,113 --> 00:37:34,813
say that you beat me

608
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,650
when you found out
about my lover.

609
00:37:39,485 --> 00:37:42,121
I see.

610
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:44,455
So you want to involve Ted?

611
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:45,957
Oh, well, that'll be fun,

612
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:48,492
bringing the police
up to speed on all of that.

613
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:51,428
But not as much fun as
telling your 16-year-old son

614
00:37:51,463 --> 00:37:54,298
that his father
is a wife-beater.

615
00:37:54,332 --> 00:37:56,834
Also not a very good plan.
What else you got?

616
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:59,570
I could send Junior
away to school.

617
00:37:59,604 --> 00:38:01,880
Oh. Now here's
the conversation...

618
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:05,148
"So, honey, I know you've
only got one year left in high school,

619
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:07,844
but I would love it so much
if you would drop everything,

620
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:11,048
leave all your friends behind, and
go to boarding school in Arizona."

621
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,583
You have any other ideas?
Because I'm not hearing

622
00:38:13,617 --> 00:38:15,642
a solution to your problem.

623
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:18,831
How are you going
to save our kids

624
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:20,589
from this terrible environment?

625
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:22,391
- I--
- What are you gonna do?

626
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,859
Are you gonna run off
to France?

627
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,661
Are you gonna close the
curtains, change the locks?

628
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:27,663
This is a joke.
Come on, Skyler.

629
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:31,167
You wanna take me on?
You wanna take away my children?

630
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:35,303
- What's the plan?
- I don't know!

631
00:38:35,337 --> 00:38:37,939
This is the best
I could come up with, okay?

632
00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:41,009
I-- I will count
every minute

633
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:42,677
that the kids
are away from here,

634
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:44,612
away from you, as a victory.

635
00:38:44,646 --> 00:38:47,881
But you're right.

636
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:50,818
It's a bad plan.

637
00:38:50,852 --> 00:38:55,388
I don't have any
of your magic, Walt.

638
00:38:55,423 --> 00:38:57,091
I don't know what to do.

639
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,326
I'm a coward.

640
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,561
I-- I can't go
to the police.

641
00:39:01,596 --> 00:39:03,563
I can't stop
laundering your money.

642
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:05,497
I can't keep you
out of this house.

643
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:08,134
I can't even keep you
out of my bed.

644
00:39:09,636 --> 00:39:12,471
All I can do is wait.

645
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:14,841
That's it.
That's the only good option.

646
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,375
Hold on,

647
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:18,344
bide my time,

648
00:39:18,378 --> 00:39:20,045
and wait.

649
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:25,316
Wait for what?
What are you waiting for?

650
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:30,021
For the cancer to come back.

651
00:40:17,797 --> 00:40:19,297
Yeah?

652
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:23,068
Okay. Okay.

653
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:25,936
Just relax.
I'm coming.

654
00:40:38,684 --> 00:40:41,285
Look at that.
You tell me what that looks like.

655
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:43,354
If the DEA's tracking
her barrels,

656
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:45,222
there goes
our precursor connection.

657
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:47,724
That's done.
And I'm telling you these days,

658
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:50,660
chances of getting a new
methylamine hook-up is rare, man.

659
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:52,729
It's like Bigfoot.
Like unicorn-rare.

660
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:57,234
Kid, it's just--
You're giving me heartburn here.

661
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:59,835
GPS on the bottom
of the barrel.

662
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,438
Why didn't they put it inside
where nobody would see it?

663
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:04,307
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

664
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:06,609
They made these things
to put under cars.

665
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:08,211
They can get wet.

666
00:41:08,245 --> 00:41:09,545
Huh.

667
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:12,715
Even by cop standards
this is sloppy.

668
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,216
And the other barrels--

669
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,684
They have trackers
on the outside too?

670
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:19,821
I don't know.
Probably.

671
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:22,857
- You didn't check any
of the other barrels? - No.

672
00:41:22,892 --> 00:41:25,327
But that's the only one we
could've taken, according to her.

673
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,329
Once we spotted it,
she freaked out,

674
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:30,398
I put the barrel back,
and we FO'd.

675
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:32,366
Let me ask you something.

676
00:41:32,401 --> 00:41:34,501
The person
who spotted this--

677
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:36,537
Was it you or was it her?

678
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:39,106
Lydia.
She saw it first.

679
00:41:40,508 --> 00:41:42,009
Okay.

680
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:43,844
She's dead.

681
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:45,446
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

682
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,548
Lydia planted this thing,
not the cops.

683
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:50,383
She's thinking
if she makes it look

684
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:52,385
like her inventory's
being watched

685
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,388
that we'll leave her alone
and take our business elsewhere.

686
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:56,856
And she's right,

687
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,973
we will be taking
our business elsewhere,

688
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,129
right after I leave her
alone in a ditch.

689
00:42:02,164 --> 00:42:04,529
But wait, hey, if the DEA's
not tracking her stuff,

690
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,631
that's a good thing, right?

691
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,400
I mean, all we gotta do
is tell her to,

692
00:42:08,435 --> 00:42:10,469
you know, cut the crap
and keep the methylamine coming.

693
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:12,571
You don't know
this woman like I do.

694
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:15,874
I had a chance to deal with this
before, and I gave her a pass.

695
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,909
That's what I get
for being sexist.

696
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:19,577
Now, if you'll excuse me...

697
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:21,446
Mike, you can't just...

698
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,015
Look, that's our precursor.
We need her.

699
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:27,685
Kid, if we have to ramp down
for a while, so be it.

700
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,122
It beats working with a lunatic
who's gonna get us arrested or killed.

701
00:42:31,156 --> 00:42:33,924
Look, she didn't seem crazy
to me, you know?

702
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:35,726
She just seemed, like, uptight.

703
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,061
And now you're being sexist.

704
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,664
Trust me, this woman
deserves to die

705
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:43,133
as much as any man
I've ever met.

706
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:45,202
No. Wait!

707
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,037
Just wait.

708
00:42:47,038 --> 00:42:49,306
What if this really was
the cops, you know?

709
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,308
- And what if you're wrong about her?
- I'm not wrong.

710
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:54,644
But what if you are?

711
00:42:54,678 --> 00:42:58,515
Jesse, your misgivings
have been duly noted.

712
00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:01,317
Now move away from me.

713
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:03,452
No. This is
a voting thing.

714
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:07,322
- I don't think so.
- I vote it's a voting thing.

715
00:43:07,356 --> 00:43:09,290
Mr. White,
weigh in here, would you?

716
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:11,693
What do you think?

717
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:14,462
Mr. White?

718
00:43:22,671 --> 00:43:26,106
The methylamine keeps flowing,
no matter what.

719
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:29,276
We are not ramping down.

720
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,547
We're just getting started.

721
00:43:32,581 --> 00:43:35,883
Nothing stops this train.

722
00:43:35,918 --> 00:43:38,052
Nothing.

723
00:43:39,554 --> 00:43:42,589
Hey, yo, Mr. White.
Hold up.

724
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:47,594
I just wanted to say
I liked your idea.

725
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:50,931
You know, it's pretty, uh...

726
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:53,499
I think it's the way to go.

727
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,470
Oh, hey, um,

728
00:43:58,504 --> 00:44:02,007
you said it was your--
your birthday, so...

729
00:44:04,578 --> 00:44:06,545
I left the receipt in the box

730
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,014
in case you wanna exchange it.

731
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:13,918
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

732
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,168
Hi.

733
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:41,378
I, uh, stopped by
Hank and Marie's.

734
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:45,615
Junior is still asking,
"what is going on?"

735
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:48,384
Nonstop, very insistently.

736
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:50,720
But everything's okay.

737
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:54,090
They're watching <i>Ratatouille.</i>

738
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,192
It's very sweet.

739
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,995
How are you?

740
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,272
There's gonna be some more
money coming in soon.

741
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:12,407
Is that okay?

742
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:15,610
Fine.

743
00:45:15,644 --> 00:45:17,278
Good.

744
00:45:20,048 --> 00:45:22,517
So...

745
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:25,219
Are you coming to bed?

746
00:45:49,942 --> 00:45:51,943
I wanna show you something.

747
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:56,614
See that watch?

748
00:45:56,649 --> 00:45:59,784
It's a birthday present.

749
00:45:59,818 --> 00:46:02,820
The person who gave me
this present

750
00:46:02,854 --> 00:46:05,490
wanted me dead too.

751
00:46:05,524 --> 00:46:07,892
Not that long ago,

752
00:46:07,926 --> 00:46:09,959
he pointed a gun
right between my eyes,

753
00:46:09,994 --> 00:46:11,695
right here,

754
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:14,498
and he threatened to kill me.

755
00:46:16,267 --> 00:46:19,469
He changed his mind
about me, Skyler,

756
00:46:20,471 --> 00:46:22,806
and so will you.
