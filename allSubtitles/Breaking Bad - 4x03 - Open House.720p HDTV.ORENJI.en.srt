00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:10,277
- You're so strong today!
- Marie, get out.

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,834
I'm going to work.
Keep this party going!

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:19,281
Walter White wants to buy my car wash,
the price he pays is 20 million dollars.

5
00:00:20,718 --> 00:00:23,419
He cuts a man's throat
just to send a message?

6
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:25,538
Get me in a room with him.

7
00:00:25,857 --> 00:00:27,000
You're done?

8
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:03,815

10
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,930
I'm not leaving.

11
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:47,504
Walt, I'm not leaving.

12
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,774
Oh, my god.

13
00:02:58,115 --> 00:02:59,582
Ah.

14
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:03,385
I can hear
your cell phone ringing!

15
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:07,889
This is ridiculous.
I can't--

16
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:12,292
Ah.

17
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:15,062
Uh, what is going on with you?

18
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:17,331
I've left you,
like, 23 messages.

19
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:18,466
And?

20
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,535
And?

21
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,738
We need to
talk about the car wash.

22
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:26,475
You know, Skyler, now is not
a good time for me, okay?

23
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:27,810
Can we talk about this later?

24
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:29,411
No, okay? We can't.

25
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:33,949
Why are you do--

26
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:36,418
Oh, Jesus.

27
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:37,620
What happened?

28
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:39,355
Nothing. I just
bumped it. That's all.

29
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,857
Okay, I'm-- I'm coming in.

30
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:53,770
Okay, exactly what happened?

31
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:57,708
It's complicated, and I
don't wish to discuss it.

32
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:58,775
It's none of your concern.

33
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,876
Are you in danger?

34
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:03,413
Uh--

35
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:07,851
Walt, I need you
to look me in the eye

36
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:10,921
and tell me right now,
are you in danger?

37
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:12,289
You know what?

38
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:15,725
Let's just say that I have
a hell of a lot more

39
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,829
on my mind right now

40
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:21,664
than thinking about buying
a damn car wash.

41
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:22,832
Okay.

42
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:26,503
So if you could just please...

43
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,377
Okay. Then we go
to the police.

44
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,813
What?

45
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:39,248
We-- We tell them
everything--

46
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:42,852
That you're a drug dealer
afraid for your safety,

47
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:45,054
and-- And the safety of
your family-- Whoa. Whoa.

48
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,055
And you need--
You need help.

49
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,223
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

50
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:48,291
What choice is there, Walt?

51
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:49,325
What choice?

52
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,559
If you're in danger--

53
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:51,861
Then it would be
absolutely--

54
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:53,796
Stop, stop, stop.

55
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,898
You keep saying
that word, danger--

56
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:57,766
- Danger.
- But you just said--

57
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:59,368
No, and I have never
used that word.

58
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:01,203
I said things were complicated,

59
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:02,871
and then you flew
off the handle.

60
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:06,808
Yeah, I flew off the handle
when I saw that, okay?

61
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:08,543
Where'd that come from?
Hmm?

62
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:10,444
A fall in the shower?

63
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,550
Uh, this is just so
passive-aggressive, you know? I--

64
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,619
Passive-aggressive?
Are y--

65
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:18,887
I go two days

66
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:20,622
without returning
your phone calls, two days,

67
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:23,959
and I have one minor
little incident,

68
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:25,528
and now
you're telling me to--

69
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:27,964
I should turn myself in
to the police, for God's sake.

70
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:29,332
- A minor little incident?
- Yes.

71
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:32,469
What minor little incident?

72
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:37,040
I had an argument
with a co-worker.

73
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:38,641
Okay?

74
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:41,410
And?

75
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:43,445
I had an argument.

76
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,413
We were in this bar,

77
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:46,981
and we were discussing

78
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,749
a particular business strategy,

79
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:52,753
and-- And it got heated
and out of control,

80
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,788
and he hit me-- Once.

81
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:58,226
And I didn't retaliate
because he's a much older man.

82
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,662
And that's it.

83
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:05,767
You were in a bar fight?

84
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:13,509
Yes, Skyler,
I was in a bar fight.

85
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,546
So you're okay?

86
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,017
Really?

87
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,359
Yes. I'm okay.

88
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,797
And I think in the end

89
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:33,032
it may have been
a good thing, actually,

90
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:35,067
because we were able
to clear the air

91
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:37,670
and, you know, mutual respect.

92
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:40,273
So--

93
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:43,876
Frozen peas.

94
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:47,313
What?

95
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:48,915
It's the best thing
for the swelling.

96
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,785
Oh, it-- It--
It's not really swollen.

97
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:52,786
It's--

98
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,853
No peas.

99
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,523
You don't even have ice.

100
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:59,092
I will get peas.
I will get ice.

101
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,062
Peas and ice.
I'm writing it down.

102
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:03,931
I, uh...

103
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:08,937
I need you to...

104
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:14,075
Promise me that if things
do get dangerous--

105
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:16,311
promise me.

106
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,146
Absolutely.

107
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,049
So--

108
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,386
Car wash.

109
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:42,335
Charles?

110
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,111
Hi, there. Can I
answer any questions?

111
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:55,513
Yes.

112
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:57,081
Any chance
of a top-off?

113
00:07:57,115 --> 00:07:59,984
Oh, I think we can
help you out there.

114
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:10,094
So what do you think?

115
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:13,498
Oh. Very nice. Very open.

116
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,801
Oh. I agree. It flows.

117
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:17,803
A whole lot of natural light.

118
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:19,605
Uh, Michael Kilbourne.

119
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,307
Tori Costner.

120
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:22,541
It's nice to meet you.

121
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:24,844
Well, three bedrooms,
one and a half baths,

122
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,413
on just under half an acre.

123
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:29,383
That's a non-attached
casita out in back,

124
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:32,719
permit usable as office
or guest suite.

125
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:33,720
Hmm.

126
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:34,988
Plank wood floors.

127
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:36,322
Central heat and air.

128
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:38,624
I--
I see you're married.

129
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:41,760
No. Divorced, very recent.

130
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:43,095
Old habits.

131
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,096
Oh. I'm sorry.

132
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,563
Any children?

133
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:48,299
Yes. As a matter of fact,
a little boy.

134
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,366
Oh. How old?

135
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:50,834
Uh, he turned 4 in may.

136
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,770
He's a gemini.
Would love this yard.

137
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:55,106
Oh, well, plenty of space
for a jungle gym,

138
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,976
and the neighborhood
preschool is fantastic.

139
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,546
Oh, well, I think Eli
is going to be home-schooled.

140
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,613
Oh, well, great.

141
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,182
Not for religious reasons
or anything.

142
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,450
I just want to make sure

143
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:05,819
that he's getting
enough attention.

144
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:07,387
He'll still go
to summer camp and whatnot,

145
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,521
you know, play dates.

146
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:10,257
I don't want him to be
socially awkward.

147
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,026
Oh, no.
Makes a lot of sense.

148
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,828
He tests very highly--

149
00:09:13,862 --> 00:09:15,329
96 percentile--

150
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:16,797
But that whole
right brain, left brain--

151
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,802
You want those in balance.

152
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:25,773
You said the casita
has plumbing?

153
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:27,208
I will go out with Clay,

154
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:29,810
so I need access
to running water.

155
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:32,346
Well, it's pipe fitted
for a quarter bath,

156
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,748
so make a perfect studio.

157
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,949
Hmm.

158
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:39,887
This could work.

159
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,692
<i>Hell, that's the doctor's plan</i>

160
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:44,960
<i>to get her patients at ease,</i>

161
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:47,696
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

162
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:49,331
<i>But, nurse, I'm not one--</i>

163
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,400
Hello! I'm back!

164
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:54,069
Hank?

165
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:55,104
Yeah.

166
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:03,010
Ohh.

167
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:05,846
I had to go
to three different places

168
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,313
to get the moisturizer
that you like,

169
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:08,547
but I got that,

170
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:12,618
and I got your Shiner Bock
and your chips,

171
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:15,054
and I couldn't resist.

172
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:21,293
<i>The complete encyclopedia
to fantasy football.</i>

173
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:22,862
Look, it has
all the latest rankings.

174
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:25,964
Marie, I said Cheetos,
not Fritos.

175
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:28,200
W-wait. Uh--

176
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:30,636
I must have said Cheetos,
like, ten times.

177
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,471
You need me to write it
down for you?

178
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:33,739
No, and I don't need you

179
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:35,473
to be mean about it,
either, Mr. grumpy.

180
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:36,741
Well, I'm just saying,
you know.

181
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:39,143
I said Cheetos.
Ch-ch-ch sound,

182
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:42,612
virtually impossible to
confuse Cheetos with Fritos,

183
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:43,613
it seems to me.

184
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:44,747
Where are you going?

185
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:47,150
Uh, back to the store, I guess.

186
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:49,785
Here.

187
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:52,288
And the draft's
not for two months,

188
00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:53,689
so this is useless.

189
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,123
Can you believe it?

190
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:11,627
What?

191
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:15,030
What? This.

192
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:22,471
Well, you always thought
this place could be bugged.

193
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:23,739
Now we know.

194
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,976
Yeah, well, I don't like it.

195
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:29,079
It's a violation
of the work space.

196
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:32,382
Yeah, I guess.

197
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:35,252
Want to do something?

198
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:39,956
Do something?
Like what?

199
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,160
Go-karts?

200
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:48,097
Go-karts? What--

201
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:53,268
Yeah, there's a track
down by the Coliseum.

202
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:55,070
It's pretty fun.

203
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:00,042
No.

204
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:03,545
Actually, I have--

205
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,482
I have a meeting, so--

206
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,884
All right. Whatever.

207
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:13,524
Rain check?

208
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,526
Yeah, sure.

209
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:23,902
How you doing?

210
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:26,572
Good.

211
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:27,606
Yeah?

212
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:30,476
You okay?

213
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:36,747
Is there, uh, anything
we should talk about?

214
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,453
How's your eye?

215
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,691
Yeah, it's fine.

216
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:52,761
Anything we should talk about?

217
00:13:00,204 --> 00:13:01,805
For what it's worth...

218
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,142
Getting the shit
kicked out of you...

219
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:10,280
Not to say you, uh,
you get used to it, but...

220
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,717
You do kind of get used to it.

221
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:29,664
Two words-- Nail salon.

222
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:32,066
It's perfect
for money laundering.

223
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:34,168
It's a high volume
cash-preferred business

224
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:35,537
with a discreet work force.

225
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:38,506
I mean, nobody does
"mister, me know nothing"

226
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,776
better than Mrs.
Mookjaiaporn and her gals.

227
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,378
Mr. Goodman--

228
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:44,547
Saul, please. Now,

229
00:13:44,581 --> 00:13:46,115
for the lady
of the house--

230
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,818
Drum roll, please--

231
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:49,119
how about a lifetime supply

232
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,021
of French manicures
and enzyme peels?

233
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:52,656
Ah, yeah. Go ahead,
pinch yourself.

234
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,824
Ha ha ha!

235
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:56,527
We're not buying
a nail salon, Mr. Goodman.

236
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:58,328
We're getting the car wash.

237
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:00,531
I'm sorry. Am I missing
something here?

238
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:02,599
I mean, didn't you
already try that?

239
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,968
Yeah. I mean,
Walt told me

240
00:14:05,002 --> 00:14:07,770
that you, uh, took a run
at this Bogdan character,

241
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:09,405
and he wrestled you
into submission

242
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:10,506
with his eyebrows.

243
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,474
10 million, that was the
asking price, right?

244
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,844
Apparently, he upped it to 20.

245
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:17,779
Ha ho! Nice negotiating.

246
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,882
Yeah. I-- Hey, you bombed.
It happens.

247
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,017
You were smart to call me.

248
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:26,287
Now-- Uh,
you just sit back, relax,

249
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,356
and let a professional
take over.

250
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,390
Who is that?

251
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:31,558
That's for me. Excuse me.

252
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,664
What do you want?
I'm in a meeting.

253
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:40,299
Why didn't you
think of that before?

254
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:41,567
It's not my--

255
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:43,335
I'm in a meeting.

256
00:14:45,772 --> 00:14:48,173
Can Huell use your bathroom?

257
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:51,410
Huell?

258
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:54,646
Uh, sure.
The top of the stairs.

259
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,048
He'll be quick.

260
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:01,219
It's a stomach thing.

261
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:03,521
So where were we?

262
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:05,857
Professionalism.

263
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:09,227
Yeah. Um, so the guy
won't sell, he won't sell.

264
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,796
I don't accept that.

265
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,598
I don't accept
that he won't sell.

266
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:15,033
I-- I think he just
lacks the proper...

267
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:17,670
Motivation.

268
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:20,005
Motivation. Oh. Uh,

269
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,844
as in "motivation" motivation?

270
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:26,579
I mean, just so we're
on the same page here.

271
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:29,448
You're saying we make him
an offer he can't refuse?

272
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:32,118
Nothing so dramatic
as that, no.

273
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:33,720
Motivation.

274
00:15:36,357 --> 00:15:38,458
Attitude adjustment.

275
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:40,995
Ho ho ho ho!

276
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:44,299
This one, she's a keeper.

277
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,902
Well, an audit can be
highly motivating.

278
00:15:46,936 --> 00:15:48,770
I know a gal
over at tax and revenue.

279
00:15:48,805 --> 00:15:49,938
You give her ten minutes

280
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:51,106
on this Bogdan fella's books,

281
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:52,708
she'll have his sky
raining frogs.

282
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:56,578
No, we don't want to draw
any unwanted tax attention.

283
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:58,313
We don't want them
looking at us

284
00:15:58,347 --> 00:15:59,614
after Bogdan sells.

285
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:02,685
All right. How about
an I.C.E. raid?

286
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,620
You know he's got illegals
working over there.

287
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:06,121
I mean, he just has to.

288
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:09,257
We are not getting a bunch of poor
innocent people in trouble, no.

289
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,425
Yeah. And also, you're
going to need them

290
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,160
after you take over.
Tck.

291
00:16:14,228 --> 00:16:16,797
Hey. How about terrorism?

292
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:20,100
"Oh, agent Hoover,
I got to tell you,

293
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:22,970
"I've seen some real
islamic comings and goings

294
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:24,371
over there at the car wash."

295
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:26,874
Yeah, I mean guys in turbans
pulling up in vans

296
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,943
and stuff like that. Ha ha!

297
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:32,147
Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.

298
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:36,586
Okay, well, we're-- We're
just spitballing here, so...

299
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,690
Okay, there's always...

300
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:43,995
"You got
a real nice place here.

301
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,463
A shame if something
happened to it."

302
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:46,864
That angle.

303
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,168
What are you talking about?

304
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:52,037
Violence?

305
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:55,740
Attitude adjustment.

306
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,108
Oh, no. That? No.

307
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:58,776
That is not at all
what I meant.

308
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,478
I-- We do not do that.

309
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:01,980
That's not who we are,

310
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:03,081
right?

311
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:05,082
Yeah. No. No.

312
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:07,084
No, she-- She's right.

313
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,488
Look, do I need
to state the obvious?

314
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:12,023
I mean, there's got to be

315
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:15,627
dozens of car washes
in this area.

316
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,696
Who says it has to be this one?

317
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,865
I do.

318
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:21,767
I say it has to.

319
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:22,902
Why?

320
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:26,206
I just do.

321
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,243
God.

322
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:31,912
Well, that clears things up.

323
00:17:33,215 --> 00:17:35,549
I don't like him--
Bogdan.

324
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:38,019
He was condescending
to me, rude about you,

325
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:40,121
and I do not like him.

326
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:41,622
Simple as that.

327
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:46,327
Hey, nobody appreciates
a passionate woman

328
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:47,861
more than I do,

329
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:50,531
but, uh, in this business,

330
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,333
and Walt can
back me up on this,

331
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,202
the number 1 rule is--

332
00:17:54,236 --> 00:17:55,870
Don't take things personally.

333
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:59,340
What do you-- What do you
mean, rude about me?

334
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:07,081
Something along the lines of...

335
00:18:07,116 --> 00:18:10,718
You weren't man enough
to face him yourself.

336
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,087
What?

337
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:14,489
That you had to send your woman

338
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:16,290
to do your business for you.

339
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,228
Okay, uh, speaking
as your lawyer,

340
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:21,496
I'm going to go on record

341
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,964
and say this is a bad idea.

342
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:24,031
Now, I advise against--

343
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:25,265
It's this one.

344
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,575
Okay. So, uh...

345
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:37,579
All we have to do

346
00:18:37,613 --> 00:18:39,982
is think of a nonviolent,

347
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:42,985
unsuspicious way
to purchase the car wash

348
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,154
that-- That--
That protects the innocent

349
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:48,891
and doesn't cost $20 million.

350
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,597
Don't everybody speak at once.

351
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,148
Hi.

352
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,416
Can I answer any questions?

353
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:14,885
Oh. Spoons.

354
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,487
Yes. The owner
is quite the collector.

355
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:18,655
Aren't they something?

356
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,591
One for each of the 50 states.

357
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,793
Uh, Puerto Rico is
technically a territory.

358
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:25,996
Huh.

359
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,698
You know, maybe they
were thinking...

360
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,867
Some day.

361
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:34,270
Uh, so no basement.

362
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:35,905
No basement. Sorry.

363
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,641
That's a problem.
My brother's in the peace corps,

364
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:40,110
and won't be back
for 18 months,

365
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:43,212
and I said I'd hang
on to his furniture.

366
00:19:43,247 --> 00:19:44,914
Well, if you're looking
for storage space,

367
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,515
there's an attic area
that's sizeable.

368
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,452
Oh. Huh. Well, an attic
might be even better,

369
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:51,587
as long as it's dry.

370
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:53,055
- Let's take a tour.
- Okay.

371
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,692
Actually, I have
a handout for you.

372
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:03,299
It has all the information.

373
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,034
I'm Stephanie Doswell,
by the way.

374
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,670
Charlotte Blattner.

375
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:07,937
So nice to meet you, Charlotte.

376
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:09,339
You, too.

377
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:10,974
So I just told him
point-blank--

378
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:13,243
"You're my husband,
and I love you.

379
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,612
"But you're 53 years old.

380
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,048
"This job has just
gotten too stressful"

381
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,851
and difficult,
and it's time to quit.

382
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:25,154
And, miracle of miracles,
he listened.

383
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:26,956
Still, what
a fascinating career

384
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,557
that must have been for him.

385
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,825
It was. I mean,

386
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:33,561
NASA was like
a second family to us,

387
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:36,197
but, you know,

388
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:37,966
it was time
for a new adventure,

389
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,769
so, between his pension

390
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:43,005
and the income I bring in
from hand modeling,

391
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,240
we're, you know, comfortable.

392
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:47,443
Uh, when were these
floors redone?

393
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:48,677
Two years ago,

394
00:20:48,712 --> 00:20:50,145
and the counters are brand new.

395
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,047
I can tell. Travertine.

396
00:20:52,082 --> 00:20:53,848
Hmm.
Nice.

397
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,350
Any children?

398
00:20:55,384 --> 00:20:56,852
No.

399
00:20:56,886 --> 00:21:00,021
I don't really want kids.

400
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:02,357
Is that horrible for me
to say, do you think?

401
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:04,860
Not at all. Not everyone
has to have children.

402
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:07,629
Hmm. You should
talk to my husband.

403
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:10,098
Uh, garbage disposal?

404
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:11,266
Mm-hmm.

405
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:49,735
Aah!

406
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:24,106
Check it out.

407
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,474
Score, yo.

408
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:38,427
I really love your home.

409
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:39,628
Well, thank you, Mimi.

410
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:43,632
It has a...
Very European feel.

411
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:44,733
You think?

412
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:46,335
Oh, I lived in London
for years,

413
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,105
so yeah, this feels familiar.

414
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:50,539
Where in London?

415
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:53,609
I was stationed at Upwood
in the '60s.

416
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:54,544
Right downtown.

417
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,079
But we were almost never there.

418
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:58,414
My husband is an illustrator,
so we traveled a lot--

419
00:23:58,449 --> 00:24:00,116
Paris, Italy, Denmark.

420
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:01,785
It was before the kids
were in school,

421
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,587
so it was easy
to pick up and go.

422
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:05,423
That was before
my youngest, Lucy,

423
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:07,358
was diagnosed
with endocarditis.

424
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:08,860
Oh, my.

425
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:10,262
Gosh, is that, uh--

426
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:12,631
It's a bacterial infection
of the heart valves.

427
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:15,001
It's-- Yeah, it can be--

428
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:17,303
Mmm. That's terrible.

429
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:19,039
Is she all right?

430
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:22,309
Your daughter.

431
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:23,910
Is she okay?

432
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:26,046
Yes. Th-thank you.

433
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,048
Um, the doctor's put her
on a prosthetic valve,

434
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,783
so she's-- Lucy's fine.

435
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:33,786
Running and walking,
riding horses.

436
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,254
Well, thank goodness.

437
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:38,624
Yeah. We're...Very lucky.

438
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:39,825
Yeah.

439
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:46,532
Excuse me. Miss?

440
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:48,367
Very nice. Thank you!

441
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:50,236
I just called the police.

442
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,270
Okay, then.

443
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:53,506
I know you stole that spoon.

444
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,476
What spoon? What are you
talking about?

445
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,578
You're a thief.

446
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,447
Excuse me?

447
00:25:00,482 --> 00:25:01,348
And a liar,

448
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:02,683
making stories up
about yourself.

449
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:03,851
What's wrong with you?

450
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:05,619
No. What's the matter
with you, lady?

451
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:08,722
You better just back off, okay?

452
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:11,524
My husband is a DEA agent.

453
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,027
I thought he was an astronaut
or an illustrator.

454
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,795
You better get your
crazy lies straight.

455
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:17,096
You know what, fatty?

456
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,665
You are so lucky that I
am late for an appointment.

457
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:21,866
You're not going anywhere.

458
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:22,867
Hey, my purse.

459
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:24,336
Not until the police get here.

460
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:26,638
Let go of it! Let it go!

461
00:25:26,673 --> 00:25:27,907
Let it go!

462
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:29,308
Let it...Go!

463
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:40,655
You are in big trouble.

464
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:51,832
Yeah.

465
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:57,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

466
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:58,405
Just sl--

467
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:00,007
Slow down. Start from the--

468
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,041
You--

469
00:26:02,209 --> 00:26:03,376
You're where?

470
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:08,849
Why the f--

471
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:10,083
Why are you--

472
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:21,695
Are you seriously
doing this to me again?

473
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:28,102
Jesus, just st--

474
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:34,911
Would you stop crying?

475
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:44,954
I'll make a phone call.
Just sit tight.

476
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:50,425
Where do they got you?

477
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,669
So good news. The officer
spoke to the homeowners,

478
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,204
and they're not
going to press charges.

479
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:05,373
Good. I won't, either.

480
00:27:05,408 --> 00:27:08,877
Okay, then,
so we're good to go.

481
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:12,181
You ready?

482
00:27:20,258 --> 00:27:21,926
Marie, you want to go home?

483
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,303
Marie?

484
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:32,296
Yes, it's Skyler White

485
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,131
calling for Saul Goodman,
please.

486
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,834
Yes, it is important.

487
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:38,403
Thank you.

488
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:54,718
Sorry. Same as before.

489
00:28:54,753 --> 00:28:56,687
But this is not right.

490
00:28:56,721 --> 00:28:59,356
You cannot shut me down.
You cannot do this.

491
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,991
Mr. Wolynetz, I've checked
your waste water

492
00:29:01,025 --> 00:29:02,158
inside and out.

493
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:03,560
I've checked
your runoff gutters,

494
00:29:03,595 --> 00:29:06,130
and now out here
more contaminants--

495
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:08,098
Ammonia, acetone,

496
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,001
benzene, nitrobenzene.

497
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:12,003
No, no, no.
This is a mistake.

498
00:29:12,037 --> 00:29:13,838
Where is Gary?
He will tell you

499
00:29:13,873 --> 00:29:15,875
my soap is very good,
very green.

500
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:17,276
No, your soap is not the issue.

501
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,778
It's your filtration system.

502
00:29:18,812 --> 00:29:21,214
At the very least,
you'll need to retrofit.

503
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:23,683
But if you're leeching
into the ground water,

504
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:26,619
which is looking like
a real possibility here,

505
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:29,121
you're going to need to
replace your system entirely.

506
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:32,024
Replace? Do you know
how much cost that is?

507
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:33,459
$200,000.

508
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:35,295
Look, I understand
it's a hardship.

509
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:38,431
If you like, we can give you
a list of approved vendors.

510
00:29:38,466 --> 00:29:40,133
If you get going immediately,

511
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,601
your down time
shouldn't be any more

512
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:42,736
than four or five weeks.

513
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:45,405
Okay. So sorry. You're right.

514
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,808
From now on,
we will be extra careful

515
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:51,144
and, uh, clean.

516
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:52,579
No more pollution, okay?

517
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:54,181
- Yes?
- No, I'm sorry.

518
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:55,649
The state requires you

519
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:57,484
to suspend
all commercial activity

520
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,987
until these levels reach
the mandated minimums.

521
00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:02,790
Where is usual man?
Where is Gary?

522
00:30:02,824 --> 00:30:04,692
He got transferred
to Las Cruces.

523
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:06,827
If you'd like to file an
appeal, you can contact--

524
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:08,762
I have done nothing wrong.

525
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:10,730
Tell me, why you shut me down?

526
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,132
What laws did I break?

527
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:13,200
What laws? Several.

528
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:15,802
Tell me exact specific laws,
or I refuse.

529
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:16,837
- Specific?
- Right now.

530
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:18,205
The--

531
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,406
Tell me exact--

532
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,540
- The specific laws--
- What laws?

533
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:21,575
<i>Hold on, okay?</i>

534
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:22,576
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

535
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,643
Wait, wait, wait.

536
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:25,212
Okay. Okay.

537
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:28,581
The New Mexico
hazardous waste act of 1978,

538
00:30:28,616 --> 00:30:30,850
section 74, chapter 4,

539
00:30:30,885 --> 00:30:34,587
part 13 states, "whenever
the disposal of solid waste

540
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:36,155
or hazardous waste presents--"

541
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,425
An imminent
or substantial endangerment,

542
00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:42,429
the offender may be fined
not more than $5,000

543
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:44,130
each day in which
the violation occurs.

544
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:45,665
All right. Okay.

545
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:48,501
Now the...

546
00:30:48,535 --> 00:30:51,070
Okay. Okay, baby.

547
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:55,775
All right.
The EPA can cite him

548
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,378
under the toxic
substances--

549
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:00,613
Control act of 1976,

550
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:02,615
U.S. code title 15,

551
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:03,849
chapter 53--

552
00:31:03,883 --> 00:31:05,050
Subchapter 1--

553
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:07,553
Section 2606.

554
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:10,155
Satisfied?

555
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:13,626
Was that specific--

556
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,894
Enough for you?

557
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:34,794
All done with lunch?

558
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:35,862
Hmm.

559
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:40,233
You hardly touched this.

560
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:41,902
I'm not hungry.

561
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:44,271
Well...

562
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:47,474
I'm leaving the rice pudding.

563
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,143
I'm not hungry, Marie.

564
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:51,544
So don't eat it.

565
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,736
Hey, Marie.
How you doing?

566
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,873
I-- I'm okay.
Is there a problem?

567
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:23,176
No, no.
Everything's fine.

568
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,077
I'm here for Hank, actually.

569
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:27,648
Oh. You're so sweet.

570
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:29,283
Hank will be thrilled.

571
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:43,531
Sweetie, you have a visitor.

572
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,202
Ah, Jesus.
What now?

573
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:49,437
She rob a bank?

574
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:51,205
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

575
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:54,741
Oh, well,

576
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:56,043
can't complain, you know.

577
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:57,344
Every day a little better.

578
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:59,580
That's good.
You're looking good.

579
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:02,516
Yeah, well, handsome
was never the hard part.

580
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:05,485
Come on in.
Grab a seat.

581
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:08,821
Yeah, just throw
that stuff anywhere.

582
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,560
Listen, uh...

583
00:33:13,594 --> 00:33:16,096
Thanks again for the other day.

584
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,931
You know, this--
This whole thing,

585
00:33:17,965 --> 00:33:21,235
it's, uh,
it's been hard on her.

586
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:23,738
Forget it. Glad to help.

587
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:28,510
So, rock collecting?

588
00:33:28,544 --> 00:33:30,812
They're minerals. Yeah.

589
00:33:30,847 --> 00:33:33,648
Uh, it's cataloging them--

590
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:35,450
Sort them, label them.

591
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:38,152
Um, it's actually
a lot of work.

592
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:40,988
Yeah?
No, it looks like it.

593
00:33:42,957 --> 00:33:45,158
So, what's up?

594
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:49,929
Well, actually, I could use
your help on something.

595
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:52,265
Homicide,
possibly drug-related.

596
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,901
You want my help on the case?

597
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:56,670
What am I, Ironside?

598
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:59,740
No. But you're a drug cop
who knows the local talent,

599
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,809
and you're a pal
I just did a favor for,

600
00:34:01,844 --> 00:34:03,511
so let me pick your brain
a second.

601
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:04,779
You ever come across a guy

602
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:06,414
by the name of Gale Boetticher?

603
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:09,017
No.

604
00:34:09,052 --> 00:34:11,687
Someone came along
and shot him in the face.

605
00:34:12,923 --> 00:34:13,922
Okay.

606
00:34:13,957 --> 00:34:15,891
No signs of forced entry,

607
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:17,493
no signs of robbery.

608
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:20,195
Okay, so it's
a crime of passion.

609
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,498
Where's the drug angle?

610
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:25,601
We found a notebook
at his place.

611
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:28,403
I made a copy for you
in case your interested.

612
00:34:28,438 --> 00:34:30,239
Looks like it pertains

613
00:34:30,273 --> 00:34:33,576
to some kind of
methamphetamine superlab.

614
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:34,877
Ah.

615
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:37,112
It's filled with
scientific formulas

616
00:34:37,146 --> 00:34:39,448
and chemical purchase lists...

617
00:34:39,482 --> 00:34:42,685
Drawings, pages
and pages of this stuff.

618
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,488
It looks big time,
but I'm no authority,

619
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,923
so I wonder if you
might take a look.

620
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:52,594
Come on, Tim, seriously.

621
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:54,963
What is this, some kind
of a charity thing?

622
00:34:54,997 --> 00:34:57,865
I thought your expertise
could be useful here.

623
00:34:57,899 --> 00:35:01,068
I'm lying here
like, uh, third base,

624
00:35:01,102 --> 00:35:03,736
living from bowel movement
to bowel movement.

625
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:06,038
I'm not even useful to myself.

626
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:09,608
Want my advice?

627
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:11,978
Take this to Steve Gomez.

628
00:35:12,012 --> 00:35:13,113
He'll help you out.

629
00:35:13,147 --> 00:35:15,548
I give this to Steve Gomez,

630
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,617
and all of a sudden
it becomes a DEA case.

631
00:35:17,652 --> 00:35:19,920
What good does that do me?

632
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:23,324
If you could just take a look,

633
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:25,693
tell me what I got here,

634
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:27,361
I'd really appreciate it.

635
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:32,667
Eh.

636
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:35,870
Whatever.

637
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:40,908
Thanks, man.

638
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,777
You take it easy.

639
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:45,178
That's what I do.

640
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,059
Well, it was a good try.

641
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:37,434
Here we go.
Time for your nap. Yeah.

642
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:39,302
Oh, you're good.

643
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,310
So...

644
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:50,148
Nail salon sounded promising.

645
00:36:50,182 --> 00:36:51,883
What do you think?

646
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,118
I think we wait.

647
00:36:54,153 --> 00:36:55,786
Wait.

648
00:36:55,821 --> 00:36:59,456
Skyler, it has been five hours.

649
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:00,824
He'll call.

650
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:02,192
Ahem. Just wait.

651
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:03,461
Just wait.

652
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:04,762
Look.

653
00:37:06,798 --> 00:37:09,567
It was a good idea.
It was a great idea.

654
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:10,734
But it didn't work.

655
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,669
So why don't we
simply chalk it up

656
00:37:12,704 --> 00:37:15,673
as a learning--

657
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:23,347
White residence.

658
00:37:24,683 --> 00:37:26,584
Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

659
00:37:27,586 --> 00:37:29,420
Am I still interested?

660
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,057
Well, I--
I think that depends.

661
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:35,261
Yes, 879
was the original offer,

662
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,597
but that seems high to me now.

663
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,332
Now I'm offering 800.

664
00:37:39,366 --> 00:37:40,700
No, no, no. No, no.
Don't do that.

665
00:37:40,735 --> 00:37:42,335
- Why?
- Don't do that.

666
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,504
Well, because you're
an unpleasant person,

667
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:46,273
Mr. Wolynetz.
You were rude to me

668
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,742
and disrespectful
towards my husband.

669
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:49,177
- Skyler--
- And furthermore,

670
00:37:49,211 --> 00:37:51,379
I've met with quite
a number of sellers,

671
00:37:51,414 --> 00:37:53,682
and the market seems
much softer than I thought.

672
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:55,750
So 800.

673
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:57,552
<i>You are talking crazy.
800?</i>

674
00:37:57,587 --> 00:37:58,820
Uh-huh.

675
00:37:58,854 --> 00:38:00,922
<i>You are a very,
very crazy lady.</i>

676
00:38:00,956 --> 00:38:03,224
Well, I understand
that you're disappointed,

677
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:05,026
but that is my final offer.

678
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,762
I'm sorry we couldn't
make it work.

679
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:08,830
Goodbye.

680
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:12,833
What are you doing?

681
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:14,735
I'm negotiating.

682
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,770
Why?

683
00:38:16,804 --> 00:38:18,338
Because I want to pay less.

684
00:38:18,373 --> 00:38:19,606
Oh, now--

685
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,742
$79,000 less?

686
00:38:22,776 --> 00:38:25,211
Who cares? Do you know
how much I make in a day?

687
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:27,346
Yeah, but that's
the very reason

688
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,580
we need to negotiate.

689
00:38:28,614 --> 00:38:30,081
We don't want
to arouse suspicion

690
00:38:30,116 --> 00:38:31,749
by not trying
to get a good deal.

691
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:34,218
Look, I get the logic.
I do.

692
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:36,855
But you just went
too far with it.

693
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,356
You're calling him names?

694
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,991
I didn't call him names.
Ohh.

695
00:38:40,025 --> 00:38:41,359
I said he was unpleasant.

696
00:38:42,394 --> 00:38:43,994
Ohh...

697
00:38:45,397 --> 00:38:47,965
Well,
he's not calling you back.

698
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,337
I mean, you didn't honestly
think that worked.

699
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:56,141
Yeah, I do.

700
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:57,443
Oh.

701
00:38:57,477 --> 00:38:59,411
No way. Sorry. No.

702
00:38:59,446 --> 00:39:01,013
- So--
- Ahem.

703
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,416
It's time to move on, okay?

704
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,351
I'm going to call Saul.

705
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,353
Where's my phone?

706
00:39:27,107 --> 00:39:28,107
Wait.

707
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:29,108
No.

708
00:39:29,142 --> 00:39:30,542
- What?
- No, just...

709
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,577
- Wait, wait.
- What for?

710
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:32,611
Wait, wait.

711
00:39:32,646 --> 00:39:33,679
For--

712
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:38,718
Oh, my God.

713
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,821
Hello.

714
00:39:43,557 --> 00:39:45,258
Hello, Mr. Wolynetz.

715
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:47,260
No one's
really paying attention

716
00:39:47,294 --> 00:39:48,428
to where these things are.

717
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:50,296
I mean, there's got to be
thousands of them

718
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:51,164
all over the world

719
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:53,165
and on boats
coming right for us.

720
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,534
And put on inside
an ice cream truck,

721
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:57,336
drive it into San Francisco.

722
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,070
I'm not even that scared

723
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,472
of burning up in cannibalism.

724
00:40:00,506 --> 00:40:02,707
To me the things that--
Thing that worries me

725
00:40:02,742 --> 00:40:04,109
is-- Is getting trampled

726
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:06,645
or-- Or shoved up
against a chain link fence

727
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,480
because if you really
think about it,

728
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:10,182
if you were against
a chain link fence

729
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:11,850
and you've got a--
A lot--

730
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:14,619
I mean a lot of people
trying to escape,

731
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:17,188
pushing hard enough forward.

732
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:19,923
It's not a joke.
You're going to get squeezed

733
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,125
right through the chain links

734
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:24,395
like Pla-doh or some
kind of soft meat.

735
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:27,030
Uh, and this is inevitable,
okay?

736
00:40:27,064 --> 00:40:30,600
And there's nothing you or me
or anyone can do about it.

737
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:32,802
And if the fence posts
are stuck deep--

738
00:40:32,836 --> 00:40:36,406
Really deep with the cement
way down inside the ground,

739
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,674
then it's definitely
happening to you.

740
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:41,244
- Blood on the wall.
- Yeah.

741
00:40:41,278 --> 00:40:42,579
Bitch.

742
00:40:42,613 --> 00:40:45,983
Somebody got shot.
Somebody probably got shot.

743
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:50,287
Like soft meat, man,

744
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,355
right through--

745
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:55,259
Being squeezed through there
like soft meat.

746
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:58,729
Like soft meat,
right through the chain.

747
00:40:58,764 --> 00:41:01,432
Right through the--
Right through the chain.

748
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:04,870
It's-- It's inevitable.
Just--

749
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:06,038
Hey.

750
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,706
Hey.

751
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:10,677
Money!

752
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:44,741
Whoo!

753
00:41:44,776 --> 00:41:45,809
Whoa.

754
00:41:45,843 --> 00:41:46,877
Ohh.

755
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:51,615
- Ohh, nice.
- Yeah.

756
00:41:57,821 --> 00:41:59,555
To...

757
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:03,792
Clean cars and clean money.

758
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:06,027
Hear, hear.

759
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:13,769
You see?

760
00:42:13,803 --> 00:42:15,871
I told you we'd get it.

761
00:42:15,906 --> 00:42:17,640
Did you?
Mm-hmm.

762
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:19,042
Wow.

763
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:26,351
Seriously, that was
really great work.

764
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:27,920
It's impressive.

765
00:42:29,823 --> 00:42:31,056
Thank you.

766
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,126
And Saul finally came through.

767
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:35,194
Ahem.

768
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:37,964
Well, I mean,
he found the guy, right?

769
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,935
Well, yes, he found the guy,

770
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:43,670
but I told him what to do
and what to say.

771
00:42:43,705 --> 00:42:46,707
You're right.
That's the hard part.

772
00:42:48,076 --> 00:42:52,446
But yes, Saul was, uh...
Finally useful.

773
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,815
Throw him a bone.

774
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:57,818
Mmm.

775
00:42:57,853 --> 00:42:59,387
Oh, my God.

776
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,856
This is truly amazing.

777
00:43:01,891 --> 00:43:05,227
Yes, well, it better be
at $320 a bottle.

778
00:43:05,261 --> 00:43:06,629
What?

779
00:43:06,663 --> 00:43:09,999
Cuvée Pol Roget,
Sir Winston Churchill.

780
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:12,635
Apparently, it was
his favorite champagne,

781
00:43:12,669 --> 00:43:14,903
so they just named it
after him.

782
00:43:14,937 --> 00:43:16,704
How did you pay for it?

783
00:43:16,739 --> 00:43:18,439
What do you mean?

784
00:43:18,474 --> 00:43:21,909
Ah. No. Cash.
I paid cash.

785
00:43:21,944 --> 00:43:25,346
No, I'm-- I'm asking
how did you, Walter White,

786
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,682
an unemployed schoolteacher,
pay for it?

787
00:43:27,716 --> 00:43:29,083
How do you explain it?

788
00:43:29,118 --> 00:43:32,486
Skyler, no one saw me.

789
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,289
Whoever sold it to you did,
and that's not the point.

790
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:38,292
The point is we're broke,
remember?

791
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:40,528
I mean, I'm waiting for your
unemployment check to come

792
00:43:40,563 --> 00:43:42,698
so I can pay the phone bill.

793
00:43:42,732 --> 00:43:44,633
I asked for an extension
from the power company.

794
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:47,903
Why? Because on paper,
we have no money.

795
00:43:47,938 --> 00:43:50,073
You are completely
overreacting.

796
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:51,875
I'm not apologizing

797
00:43:51,909 --> 00:43:54,377
for wanting to celebrate
in some small way.

798
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:56,579
I'm not asking you
to apologize, Walt.

799
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:58,815
I'm asking you to be smart.

800
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:02,117
I bought one bottle
of champagne,

801
00:44:02,152 --> 00:44:05,053
one single bottle, Skyler.

802
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:07,489
I paid cash. That's it.

803
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:09,424
That's all it takes, okay?

804
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,491
I mean, look at Watergate.

805
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:11,959
One-- One little piece
of duct tape

806
00:44:11,994 --> 00:44:13,494
- left in a door--
- Oh, my God.

807
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:15,630
Brought down the president
of the United States.

808
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:17,566
What, I'm Nixon now?

809
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,634
No, what I'm saying is

810
00:44:18,668 --> 00:44:20,736
the devil is in
the details, okay?

811
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:24,140
One little mistake,
one slip-up in our story,

812
00:44:24,174 --> 00:44:26,509
that could ruin us.

813
00:44:31,483 --> 00:44:32,783
Fine.

814
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,128
Got to destroy the evidence.

815
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:52,800
<i>When I look at this--
This image</i>

816
00:44:52,835 --> 00:44:54,469
<i>that is part of the record,</i>

817
00:44:54,503 --> 00:44:58,006
<i>I am very concerned about
what sort of distraction</i>

818
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,341
<i>that can be,</i>

819
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:00,709
<i>whether it's from any
sort of signage</i>

820
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:02,244
<i>but especially a signage</i>

821
00:45:02,278 --> 00:45:04,512
<i>that's changing
every five seconds.</i>

822
00:45:04,547 --> 00:45:06,681
<i>Thank you.</i>

823
00:45:06,715 --> 00:45:09,283
<i>Any other questions?</i>

824
00:45:09,317 --> 00:45:12,053
<i>We have a motion
and a second on the floor</i>

825
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:13,421
<i>to grant the appeal.</i>

826
00:45:13,455 --> 00:45:14,589
<i>All those in favor,</i>

827
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,057
<i>raise your hand and say yes.</i>

828
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:18,393
<i>Yes is for the affirmative.</i>

829
00:45:18,428 --> 00:45:20,062
<i>Those opposed?</i>

830
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:24,467
<i>There's five no's,
and that motion fails.</i>

831
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:26,102
<i>I would like to make a motion</i>

832
00:45:26,137 --> 00:45:27,704
<i>to uphold the decision.</i>
