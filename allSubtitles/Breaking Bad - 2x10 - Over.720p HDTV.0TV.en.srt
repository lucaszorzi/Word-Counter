3
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:28,589
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

4
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,491
Thought I would.

5
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:33,492
That inhaler really seems
to be doing the trick.

6
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:35,680
- What?
- Just take the rest of the week.

7
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:36,743
Please.

8
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:38,641
You've earned it.

9
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,241
Don't push it.

10
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:43,854
Besides,
I want you well for the weekend.

11
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:48,187
Mom wants to par-tay.

12
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:51,769
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

13
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,580
Sunday afternoon, maybe?

14
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:57,605
Nothing too big.
Just family and a few friends.

15
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:00,078
We've got a lot to celebrate.

16
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,503
Don't you think?

17
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,719
Sounds good.

18
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,669
Now,

19
00:03:22,177 --> 00:03:24,494
what are you supposed to do today?

20
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,646
Nothing.

21
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:27,228
Excellent.

22
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:34,126
Brownie points for taking a nap.

23
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:09,772
Can you meet?

24
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:14,864
I thought maybe you...

25
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:16,974
might have, you know,

26
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:18,505
kicked.

27
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:20,823
Signed off.

28
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,788
I was even checking the obits.

29
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:26,176
No such luck.

30
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:29,819
So where does it stand?

31
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:34,513
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches like,

32
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:37,595
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

33
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,839
What's the upshot?

34
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,179
The upshot.

35
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,300
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

36
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:53,857
Damn.

37
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:58,549
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

38
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:03,309
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

39
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:06,105
In fact,

40
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,255
the news is all good.

41
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:12,682
What do you mean, good?

42
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,706
You mean, like, good good?

43
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:19,820
You mean, like, remission good?

44
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,448
Remission.

45
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:24,658
Not to imply I'm cured.

46
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:26,326
I still have cancer.

47
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:30,039
But there's been a significant reduction
in the tumors.

48
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,217
How significant?

49
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:34,268
80%.

50
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,376
Dude!

51
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:37,725
No way!

52
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,799
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch, but...

53
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,790
"Options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

54
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:47,626
That's awesome!

55
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:48,902
Serious?

56
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,761
That's great, man.

57
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,155
I mean, my aunt, she never...

58
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,608
I mean, at your stage,
I didn't think that could happen.

59
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,982
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

60
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:05,658
You must be so psyched.

61
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:08,072
Of course. I am.

62
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:11,706
Now we...

63
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:16,525
I mean, what do we...

64
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:19,922
I almost forgot.

65
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:25,226
So,

66
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:27,799
how do you want to,

67
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:30,950
you know, proceed

68
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,802
in light of this kick-ass news?

69
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:40,949
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

70
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:43,624
Sell off what we have.

71
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:45,201
And then...

72
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:51,856
Then I guess...

73
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,890
I'm done.

74
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,281
Batter up!

75
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:18,606
Everyone?

76
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:22,067
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast,

77
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:24,964
with my non-alcoholic beverage.

78
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,173
Somebody kill the music.

79
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:30,918
I know one party
can't begin to repay

80
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:33,562
all your support and your...

81
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:36,219
your many, many kindnesses.

82
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:38,638
But then again,

83
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:42,818
Hank does make one mean Margarita.

84
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:49,607
We really do want to thank you.

85
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:52,353
These last few months have been...

86
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:56,906
a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

87
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:01,926
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

88
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:03,954
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

89
00:09:09,597 --> 00:09:11,897
I'm gonna stop with the sappy stuff.

90
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,995
But it's true. It really is.

91
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:18,315
And for the first time
in a long time,

92
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:21,254
we are so excited about the future.

93
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:26,212
Anyway,

94
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:29,458
I want to also express my gratitude

95
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,055
to two very special people

96
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,215
who couldn't be here today.

97
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,830
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

98
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:39,609
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz,

99
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,513
for those of you
who don't know them are...

100
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:45,820
well, they're heroes.

101
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,198
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer

102
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:53,811
to pay for Walt's treatment.

103
00:09:56,177 --> 00:09:57,327
And they did.

104
00:09:58,145 --> 00:09:58,947
So...

105
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:01,750
to Gretchen and Elliott.

106
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,757
How about the man of the hour?
Come on!

107
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:09,793
Speech!

108
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,310
It's kind of funny.

109
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:24,069
When I got my diagnosis,

110
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:25,584
cancer,

111
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,043
I said to myself,

112
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:31,604
"Why me?"

113
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:34,955
And then,

114
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:39,917
the other day,
when I got the good news...

115
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:45,145
I said the same thing.

116
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:56,076
Anyway,

117
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,269
thank you for coming.

118
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,891
Enjoy.

119
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:06,683
Cheers.

120
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:10,664
Inspirational.

121
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:14,542
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

122
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:15,991
I'll tell you that much.

123
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:19,345
A little mercury switch,
9-volt battery,

124
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,579
5 or 6 ounces of C4,

125
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,082
that's how those cartel boys party.

126
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:26,936
But why a turtle?

127
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,597
That's the best part.
It was a...

128
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:32,591
What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

129
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:36,588
Not a metaphor, not an analogy...
It's a...

130
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:39,432
What's the word I'm looking for?

131
00:11:41,085 --> 00:11:43,635
Anyway, "<i>Tortuga.</i>"

132
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,564
That was the name of our snitch.

133
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:48,398
Bean-speak for "tortoise."

134
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,629
Tortoise, turtle, what have you...

135
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:54,004
I never knew the difference myself.

136
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,746
Top me off there, will you, buddy?

137
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:57,737
Anyway,

138
00:11:58,994 --> 00:11:59,942
poetic.

139
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:03,150
I guess, yeah.
Poetic. It was poetic.

140
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:05,874
That's the word.
I guess that's the word.

141
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:27,813
Go ahead.

142
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,584
Better not let your mom see.

143
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:53,148
I think I see a hair.
Maybe two!

144
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:58,319
- There's no worm in this, right?
- That would be Mescal.

145
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,544
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

146
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:03,858
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

147
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,368
Had this firearm
instructor who was...

148
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,655
He was a good ol' boy.

149
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,269
There you go. Thanks.

150
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:14,022
I mean, this guy could put 'em away
like he had two livers, okay?

151
00:13:14,147 --> 00:13:16,657
Like a fish, okay?
Like a drunk fish.

152
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:19,025
We were drinking Mescal stupid.

153
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:20,061
But...

154
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:28,332
- What you doing there?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

155
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:31,044
The kid's 16.

156
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,630
What are you,
going for Father of the Year?

157
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,980
What are you looking at him for?

158
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:47,059
We're celebrating.
Come on.

159
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:22,410
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

160
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,787
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

161
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:34,231
Bring the bottle back.

162
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,277
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

163
00:14:40,498 --> 00:14:42,974
My son! My bottle! My house!

164
00:14:46,974 --> 00:14:47,949
It's all right.

165
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:49,824
What are you waiting for?

166
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:51,623
Bring it back.

167
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:01,491
Why don't we just call it a day?

168
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,910
All right, pal?

169
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:07,597
We good?

170
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:09,369
The bottle.

171
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:12,850
Now.

172
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,871
What's going on?

173
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:34,434
Here, sweetie.

174
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:00,241
This is your brain.

175
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:06,954
This is your brain on drugs.

176
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,890
You weren't supposed to wake up.

177
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,276
Ever or...?

178
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,105
I was just thinking that I'd bring it,
you know, in.

179
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,584
You want me to go back to bed?

180
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:35,477
I guess that'd be kind of...

181
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:42,913
Need some help?

182
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:44,588
I got it.

183
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:48,787
Just have a seat.

184
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:51,435
Is there any coffee?

185
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:55,080
Shit.
One second.

186
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:57,512
At least let me do that.

187
00:16:57,637 --> 00:17:00,687
I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

188
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,206
All right. Here.

189
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,196
You take the good one.

190
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:15,392
It's huevos rancheros.

191
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:17,226
I can tell.

192
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:21,933
Fork.

193
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:34,517
There you go.

194
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:38,042
So what are you up to today?

195
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:41,084
Working?
Whatever that means.

196
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:47,253
I'm all yours.

197
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:49,342
Really?

198
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:34,352
<i>Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

199
00:18:40,882 --> 00:18:43,077
I just wanted to say that...

200
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:46,896
We'll talk tonight,

201
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,697
but I wanted to say that

202
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:57,616
I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday,

203
00:18:57,741 --> 00:18:59,091
but it wasn't me.

204
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:03,323
I'm sorry.

205
00:19:06,415 --> 00:19:07,415
Love you.

206
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:03,007
<i>I just wanted to say that...</i>

207
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,831
<i>We'll talk tonight,</i>

208
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:10,736
- <i>but I wanted to say that...</i>
- Hey, there.

209
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:14,723
- Who brought the churros?
- That would be me.

210
00:20:15,228 --> 00:20:18,408
If I leave 'em at home, I'll wind up
eating them all myself, so.

211
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,120
They're actually leftovers.

212
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,738
We had a little
get-together for Walt.

213
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,875
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

214
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:29,222
Actually,

215
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:31,404
Walt's got...

216
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,927
He's been... battling cancer.

217
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:41,878
And last week, we got good news.

218
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:43,516
I'm so sorry.

219
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:45,912
But we're really optimistic.

220
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:46,895
Great.

221
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:49,522
Good news is great.

222
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:52,438
Yeah, it is. It really is.

223
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:01,477
Feel free to bring these any time.

224
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:16,188
Got some real beauts.

225
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:23,172
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

226
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:28,822
Then again, what about tankless?

227
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:32,690
Sure. We got 'em.

228
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:35,964
The good ones will really run up
your price though.

229
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:38,674
Set you back about 1,200.

230
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:41,881
It's not an issue.

231
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:49,261
- You want installation, right?
- No. I'm gonna do it myself.

232
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:52,648
That's what I like to hear.

233
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:06,266
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

234
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:09,514
That's Hover Man.

235
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:12,454
He can surf, skate, glide,

236
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:16,852
whatever, 'cause he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

237
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,388
That's cool. Great lines.

238
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:26,911
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

239
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:29,835
That's Kanga Man.

240
00:22:30,396 --> 00:22:32,876
Kanga Man.
Half man, half kangaroo?

241
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:35,433
And who's this in his pouch?

242
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:37,380
His sidekick Joey.

243
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,936
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know,

244
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,969
fights crime.

245
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:46,006
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:48,626
You know that, right?

247
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:51,561
Only female kangaroos have pouches.

248
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:53,279
I know.

249
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,040
But, you know,
it's definitely a dude.

250
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:58,401
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:01,571
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

252
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:05,995
And this is?

253
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,017
It's Backwardo.

254
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:12,081
Wait, no. I actually
changed it to Rewindo.

255
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:16,252
Anyways, he goes backwards.
He can make everything go in reverse.

256
00:23:16,654 --> 00:23:18,708
Time and stuff?
Like time traveling?

257
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,257
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:23,577
He walks backwards.

259
00:23:24,812 --> 00:23:27,362
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

260
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,225
He does it, like, really fast.

261
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:33,748
Look, say someone's coming
at him with a knife. Right?

262
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:36,856
It's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from 'em.

263
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,454
I was a kid

264
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,196
when I drew all these.

265
00:23:43,826 --> 00:23:45,776
It was, like, four years ago.

266
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,540
They all look like you.

267
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:49,811
What?

268
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,493
It's you in all of these.

269
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:58,743
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

270
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,338
Shut up.

271
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:03,174
Like you never wanted a superpower.

272
00:24:11,372 --> 00:24:13,172
Is that your door or mine?

273
00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:14,447
I don't know.

274
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:17,939
It sounds like mine.

275
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,275
I gotta go.

276
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:28,366
Where?

277
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:31,924
Where?

278
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,667
Hold up.
Where are you...

279
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:16,636
Hey, Dad.

280
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,282
There you are.

281
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
Hi, honey.

282
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:23,769
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

283
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,799
Sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

284
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:30,117
Finally realized that
I wasn't the drum track?

285
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:31,469
Exactly.

286
00:25:31,918 --> 00:25:35,818
I was in the neighborhood. Was wondering
if you wanted to grab some lunch.

287
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,046
Sure.

288
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:42,055
This your dad?

289
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:48,643
This is the new tenant.

290
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:49,656
Donald.

291
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:50,797
Jesse.

292
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,103
I'm sorry.
Did you need something?

293
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:04,791
Dad, why don't you come in?
It was nice seeing you.

294
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:07,366
- It was nice to meet you.
- You, too.

295
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:37,703
Hey, Dad.

296
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:40,417
Hey, son.

297
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:42,338
Are you home early?

298
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:45,445
Oh, man.

299
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,351
Did you have a good day?

300
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:52,342
Now it is.
Finally, hot water.

301
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,803
No more toxic waste.

302
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:56,277
Yes, indeed.

303
00:26:56,402 --> 00:26:59,600
Top-of-the-line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

304
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,720
Sweet.

305
00:27:02,897 --> 00:27:04,797
Want to take her for a spin?

306
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,464
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

307
00:27:08,589 --> 00:27:12,039
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

308
00:27:14,685 --> 00:27:17,259
The pilot... in.

309
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,862
Ignition. Bingo.

310
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:23,706
Ready!

311
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:25,585
All right. Let her rip!

312
00:27:33,705 --> 00:27:35,711
117,000 BTUs.

313
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:40,592
Built-in corrosion
resistant draft reducer,

314
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:43,102
safety thermocouple
at the pilot burner.

315
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:45,354
Sounds really good, Dad.

316
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:48,101
And the energy savings.
I mean...

317
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:50,237
Careful, careful, careful.

318
00:27:50,362 --> 00:27:53,378
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make there. Are you okay?

319
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:54,834
I'm fine.

320
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:02,246
Son, about yesterday...

321
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,830
I'm sorry about the pool.

322
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:09,003
That was not your fault.
Not at all.

323
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:14,537
Your old man embarrassed himself,

324
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:17,252
and I'm not very proud
of my behavior.

325
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:20,301
I have to say I feel very foolish.

326
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:27,384
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

327
00:28:29,448 --> 00:28:31,401
We're fine. Everything's fine.

328
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:35,321
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

329
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:40,983
But, son,
I owe you an apology most of all.

330
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:45,514
I should have used
better judgment all around.

331
00:28:46,654 --> 00:28:49,904
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right,

332
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,940
and for that I'm very sorry.

333
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:54,383
But I kept up, right?

334
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:58,082
You and Uncle Hank.

335
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,043
I drank three.

336
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:09,807
I have some tools to put away.

337
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:19,021
You want to catch a movie later?

338
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:25,973
What?

339
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:28,050
What was that all about?

340
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:30,261
What?

341
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:32,508
Before. With your dad.

342
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,332
It wasn't about anything.

343
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:40,966
So I totally just misread
your total dis?

344
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,782
If anything,
I was doing you a favor.

345
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:44,943
A favor?

346
00:30:46,168 --> 00:30:48,118
I told you.
He's a hard-ass.

347
00:30:48,665 --> 00:30:51,325
- He seemed cool to me.
- Yeah, well...

348
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:54,933
- So what's the deal?
- There's no deal.

349
00:30:55,058 --> 00:30:57,808
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

350
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:01,359
- How's that?
- I mean,

351
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:05,413
I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

352
00:31:06,454 --> 00:31:07,660
I bought a filter.

353
00:31:07,785 --> 00:31:10,535
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

354
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,312
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

355
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:14,406
So?

356
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:18,627
- So?
- You think I'm going to be all like,

357
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,076
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

358
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,447
"And by the way,
I'm sleeping with him"?

359
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,200
That's all you think you're doing?

360
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:29,227
- Why do you even care about my dad?
- I don't!

361
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:31,539
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

362
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:35,084
Us. All right?
I'm talking about us.

363
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:36,269
Us.

364
00:31:39,108 --> 00:31:40,089
You and me.

365
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,340
Who's you and me?

366
00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:53,284
I'm out of here.

367
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:47,023
Dad!

368
00:33:53,085 --> 00:33:53,897
Dad?

369
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:56,825
What?

370
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:01,897
- What are you doing?
- We've got rot.

371
00:34:02,427 --> 00:34:03,244
Rot?

372
00:34:05,115 --> 00:34:07,009
I'll show you.
Here.

373
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,128
Take a look at that.

374
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:11,949
See that?

375
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:13,909
Ever seen anything like it?

376
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:17,621
- It's wood.
- It's wood

377
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:19,707
that contains fruiting bodies.

378
00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:21,625
Fruity what?

379
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:24,879
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

380
00:34:25,471 --> 00:34:27,536
I don't really see anything.

381
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:31,093
Well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

382
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:33,721
Then you cut it all out.

383
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,348
You just cut it out and start fresh.

384
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:39,557
Well, better get to it.

385
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:43,439
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

386
00:34:44,178 --> 00:34:45,728
Not if I can help it.

387
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,737
You bucking for a promotion?
Go home already.

388
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:19,395
I will.

389
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:24,605
Can I just ask...

390
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,141
the Keller account.

391
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:28,584
Keller account...

392
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,909
It's listed as a Current Asset
on this balance sheet,

393
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:36,411
but the invoice was never
presented to Accounts Receivable, so.

394
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:37,637
God.

395
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,033
One of these days I'm going to have
to sort through all the Dad stuff.

396
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:44,686
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships

397
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,768
with these little companies.

398
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:49,104
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

399
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:50,081
Or not.

400
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:52,440
Right.

401
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:57,137
Seriously, you're not
gonna make me lock you in, are you?

402
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:04,173
Jesus.

403
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,719
I'm fine.

404
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:13,821
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

405
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:17,529
I'll see you tomorrow.

406
00:36:24,607 --> 00:36:25,582
What's wrong?

407
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:31,158
I guess it just

408
00:36:34,581 --> 00:36:37,304
doesn't feel any different.

409
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:43,108
The...

410
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:45,436
good news?

411
00:36:46,751 --> 00:36:47,672
I mean,

412
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,239
nothing's really changed.

413
00:36:52,638 --> 00:36:54,138
It's just postponed.

414
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,616
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

415
00:37:00,492 --> 00:37:01,359
But...

416
00:37:04,031 --> 00:37:05,981
lately, it just feels like...

417
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:09,499
More tunnel.

418
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,436
I'm sorry.

419
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:20,679
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

420
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:22,919
I don't know.

421
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:26,178
For me, it was the flu.

422
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:27,707
What?

423
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:30,286
My dad rallied at the end.

424
00:37:30,411 --> 00:37:32,816
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got,

425
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:35,641
different circumstances,
but we were happy,

426
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:37,460
we were over the moon.

427
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:40,783
And right then, I got sick.

428
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:44,009
Flu. Boom.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

429
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:46,815
Couldn't get out of bed,
couldn't move.

430
00:37:47,669 --> 00:37:48,819
Great timing.

431
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:55,328
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking,

432
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:56,555
Why now?

433
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,595
Being that rock...

434
00:38:05,354 --> 00:38:08,911
Being that rock
takes everything you got.

435
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:05,265
Are you going to work today?

436
00:40:08,093 --> 00:40:09,593
Skyler, there's rot.

437
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,139
Damn!

438
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,697
- Clumsy.
- I got it.

439
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:16,266
You don't have to do that.

440
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:44,709
You're buying the wrong matches.

441
00:43:45,424 --> 00:43:48,608
- What?
- Those matches. They're the wrong kind.

442
00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:52,439
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips,

443
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:54,447
not the matches themselves.

444
00:43:54,572 --> 00:43:58,243
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

445
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:04,416
More striker strips.
You understand?

446
00:44:05,254 --> 00:44:06,954
Those only have the one.

447
00:44:07,468 --> 00:44:09,919
And don't buy everything
in one place.

448
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:11,685
Do it piecemeal.

449
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,078
Different items, different stores.

450
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:15,903
Attracts less attention.

451
00:44:19,098 --> 00:44:20,640
Are you following me here?

452
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,454
There he is.
That's the guy.

453
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:44,935
Stay out of my territory.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
