2
00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:04,128
Are you going to El Paso now?

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,214
All I'm asking
is for you to set a meet.

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,342
This is my formula.
This is mine.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,218
All of it would be for nothing

6
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,012
if we don't accept what I've earned.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,848
- My husband makes meth.
- Your husband is a drug dealer?

8
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,520
- This is only half.
- Your half.

9
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,189
Tell me where this came from.

10
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:25,184
He drove an RV.

11
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,443
I was able
to pull out some snapshots

12
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,611
out of an ATM security camera.

13
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:36,828
I am awake.

14
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,793
You are not how I remember you
from class. Like, not at all.

15
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:54,817
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand.
My guy wants 85.

16
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,204
This is all the money I have
in the world.

17
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,414
You are a drug dealer.
Negotiate.

18
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:06,482
Buy the RV.

19
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:09,699
We start tomorrow.

20
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:21,040
Work it, work it, baby.

21
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:22,915
This is sick, brother.

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,166
Totally.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,471
I got these two fine ladies
want to participate.

24
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:31,560
You got the funds?

25
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:33,175
I got the funds.

26
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:35,845
Would you ladies
like to meet my fat stack?

27
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:39,348
Get in here.

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,413
Come on.

29
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,513
You got champagne?
None of that cheap stuff.

30
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:50,443
I want the expensive shit.
Don Perig-non.

31
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:51,986
It's 400 a bottle.

32
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:55,605
In that case, I'll only have two.

33
00:01:56,247 --> 00:01:58,492
And I want the tall, skinny glasses.

34
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,476
I like those skinny glasses.

35
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,547
That's what James Bond drinks.

36
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:05,385
Mofos, I'm all about that.

37
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:08,301
I gotta ask.

38
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:10,838
Where'd you get all the cheddar?

39
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,980
Must be moving mad volume.

40
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:14,462
It's totally funny.

41
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:16,515
- You want to know what's funny?
- What's funny?

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,247
- This old dude, he gave it to me.
- What?

43
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,772
He gave it to me.
It's, like, his entire life savings.

44
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:22,936
What? Why?

45
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:25,224
Because he's a dumb-ass.
That's why.

46
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,839
All right, living large, players.

47
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,049
Thank you.

48
00:03:43,868 --> 00:03:44,995
That was...

49
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,062
... awesome, bro.

50
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:55,504
Later.

51
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,010
I'm so dead.

52
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:02,243
I only got...

53
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,493
damn.

54
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:09,743
I only got, like, 1,400.

55
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:12,167
Waffle House.

56
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,510
No, man.

57
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:19,592
I'm supposed to use
that dude's money to buy an RV.

58
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:22,426
What you want with an RV for?

59
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:24,514
'Cause it's like...

60
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:26,613
It's like...

61
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:29,675
never mind.

62
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:33,112
Now I've got to, like,

63
00:04:33,487 --> 00:04:36,482
leave town or change my identity
or something.

64
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,975
Guy's blackmailing me.

65
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,129
He's got, like,

66
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:43,825
a criminal mind.

67
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,932
RV?

68
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,032
I can hook you up, bro.

69
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:51,132
I can totally get you an RV.

70
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,768
No, I need it today...

71
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,411
- now.
- No problem. Let's go.

72
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:59,969
You're telling me
you can get me an RV?

73
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,343
For 1,400 at 6 in the morning?

74
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:46,909
Right on.

75
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,454
So do I need to sign something{\or something}?

76
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,820
It's, like,
a no-paperwork-type deal.

77
00:05:57,094 --> 00:05:59,036
Pleasure doing business with you.

78
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:02,920
Come on, we gotta bounce.

79
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:05,197
- What?
- For real. Get it out of here.

My God,

00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:59,835
I love this floor.

84
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:03,770
This feels fantastic.

{\pos(192,225)}I know.
Contractor talked me into it.

91
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:31,796
{\pos(192,225)}Seemed

92
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:34,108
{\pos(192,225)}kind of extravagant, but

93
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:38,081
{\pos(192,225)}I gotta tell you, once you try it,
you can't go back.

94
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,219
{\pos(192,225)}I can never find
anything in this Buick.

{\pos(192,225)}You know, you

96
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,568
could leave a few things
here if you want.

97
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,619
Why don't you go get your dad?

98
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,413
Sure.

99
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,257
Dad.

100

102
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:38,361
{\pos(192,225)}I'll be right there.

103
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:47,609
You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

104
00:08:47,734 --> 00:08:49,778
<i>Yeah, right, like you don't know.</i>

105
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:52,667
- What did I just say?
- Give me the phone. Give it.

106
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:55,924
{\pos(192,210)}Like you didn't make some deal
behind my back.

107
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,661
{\pos(192,210)}<i>Correct.
I did not.</i>

108
00:08:58,185 --> 00:09:00,016
I was sitting at a stoplight,

109
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,291
minding my own business,
when the man th...

110
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,443
the man...

111
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:04,360
the kid

112
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,282
threw a bag of money
through my window.

113
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:08,563
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

114
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:10,299
- Let me talk to him.
- <i>I owe you...</i>

115
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,420
I owe you nothing,

116
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,849
and I will get to the bottom of this.
Trust me.

117
00:09:14,974 --> 00:09:17,156
Trust you?
Trust you? That's a good one.

118
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:19,022
That's what I'm going to do.

119
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,989
{\pos(192,210)}You want to talk about trust, Jesse?
Let's talk about trust.

120
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:24,241
{\pos(192,210)}I told you not to cook my formula,

121
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:25,564
{\and you went ahead}and you did it anyway.

122
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:28,457
'Cause I never said I wouldn't
cook it 'cause it ain't yours.

123
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:30,527
It's ours. Plural, bitch.

124
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,530
You did not have my permission.

125
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:36,643
All I know is I got half
the money I'm due,

126
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:38,241
and you got the rest.

127
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,093
Escalating... You're escalating.

128
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:41,790
Escalate this.

129
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,540
My meth, my money!

<i>24...</i>

132
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:53,982
It's buttoned up tight.

133
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,529
Can't see a damn thing.

134
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,031
I ain't feeling it.

135
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:01,447
No smoke, no smell, no waste.

136
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:02,777
There's no cook.

137
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:04,795
Could be they're setting up.

138
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:06,581
I heard movement inside.

139
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,849
I say we call it a night,

140
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:10,590
come back with a search warrant.

141
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:12,635
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

142
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:15,549
There's got to be a way.

143
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:18,365
There's got to be a way.

144
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:02,531
What are you doing?

145
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:24,053
What the hell you doing up there?
You some kind of a pervert?

146
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,697
{\pos(192,210)}Go back to your trailers.
Everything's okay.

147
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:54,348
{\pos(192,210)}Guy's VFW. He's cool.

148
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,831
{\pos(192,210)}I'll tell you what. We're gonna
check out {\a couple }more and call it a morning.{\Then we're gonna call it a morning.}

149
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:00,242
{\pos(192,210)}- What do you say?
- Can't. Gotta get home.

150
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,823
Why, you leave your balls
in your wife's purse or what?

151
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,420
Gotta pack.

152
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,079
Where you headed?

153
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,099
Texas.

154
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:34,020
{\pos(192,210)}There.

155
00:13:54,357 --> 00:13:55,674
Can I come in?

156
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:58,638
Babe.

157
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,386
- How did it go last night?
- Good.

158
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,249
Catch the bad guys?

159
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:10,807
Want me to make you some breakfast?

160
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,596
I'm heading back out after this.

161
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:16,873
Now?

162
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:19,149
You worked all night.

163
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:20,233
Get some sleep.

164
00:14:20,667 --> 00:14:24,390
- Those RVs aren't going anywhere.
- They're recreational vehicles.

165
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:25,934
That's what they do.

166
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,702
You know what I mean.

167
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,014
I spoke with Blanca.

168
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,675
She said that

169
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,210
Steven's going to El Paso?

170
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:45,122
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

171
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:48,470
I turned it down.
End of story.

172
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:49,559
Good.

173
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,071
God knows I'm relieved.

174
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:53,975
I needed some time here

175
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,424
because I'm deep
into this investigation and

176
00:14:56,658 --> 00:14:59,883
couldn't do both,
so I made a judgment call.

177
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:10,367
You know that you can talk
to me about things, right?

178
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,975
You don't have
to go through this alone.

179
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:19,351
Do you ask me which lead bib to put
on someone before you nuke them?

180
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:25,282
I made a decision.
I'm not going through anything.

181
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,568
I'm doing my job.

182
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:30,220
I would like...

183
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,475
A condo in Georgetown.
I know.

184
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:35,965
If you would let me finish,
I was going to say

185
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,797
I'd like to be included.

186
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:40,113
That's all.

187
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:42,979
Don't you worry about my career.

188
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:45,068
My career is just fine.

189
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,408
Did you not want to go?

190
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:54,967
- I don't blame you. I just...
- Aren't you late for work or something?

191
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,271
I mean, what happened last time,

192
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:59,909
it would make perfect sense
for you to not want to go back.

193
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:02,566
I'm on to some important
stuff right here, right now,

194
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:06,084
and Mexico doesn't have a damn thing
to do with it. Anyone who doubts that...

195
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:09,212
I'm doing some actual good out here,

196
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,303
and all I get are
these bullshit accusations!

197
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:15,194
What, everyone thinks I'm jerking off
on this thing? Fine.

198
00:16:15,747 --> 00:16:17,479
But I'm onto something.
I know it.

199
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:18,997
You understand me?

200
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:21,897
You hear me?

201
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:23,691
{\pub}

202
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:30,800
What exactly is this?

203
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,584
I'll tell you what I think it is.

204
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:42,667
A ploy.

205
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,140
A ploy to get me cooking again...

206
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:47,213
And an obvious one at that.

207
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:48,988
How do you mean?

208
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,192
As if I would seriously believe

209
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:54,358
you would hire an addict.

210
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:56,612
Jesse Pinkman?

211
00:16:57,176 --> 00:17:00,100
- Recovering or not...
- You vouched for him previously.

212
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:01,552
I took you at your word.

213
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:03,188
No. Let me be clear.

214
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:05,337
Let me be perfectly clear.

215
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:09,616
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

216
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:14,133
Trusting him with a solo venture,

217
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:16,785
that's quite another matter.

218
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:23,563
How he could possibly produce anything
other than a mediocre product

219
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:25,494
at best.

220
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,872
I am told his product
was more or less consistent

221
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:31,060
with the quality
I had come to expect.

222
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,113
More or less?

223
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:35,858
More or less?

224
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,270
Really?

225
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:42,120
Boy, that is the...

226
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:43,853
Talk about setting the bar low.

227
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,368
Except you don't do that...

228
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,360
set the bar low.

229
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:55,907
Therefore,
what conclusion am I left to draw?

230
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,490
That you believe

231
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:03,011
I have some proprietary
kind of selfishness

232
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:04,686
about my own formula.

233
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,004
Some sort of overweening pride,
I suppose,

234
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:12,334
that you think

235
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:15,232
simply overwhelms me,

236
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:17,696
clouds my judgment.

237
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,181
But it doesn't.

238
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:21,939
Absolutely not.

239
00:18:23,137 --> 00:18:25,187
I simply respect the chemistry.

240
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,404
The chemistry must be respected.

241
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,983
I apologize for being
so transparent.

242
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,870
Would you take a drive with me?

243
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,469
I'd like to show you something.

244
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:29,834
Hi. Is everything okay?

245
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:32,587
She's already finished
an entire bottle,

246
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,278
but she still seemed hungry.
Then she fell asleep.

247
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:38,176
I was thinking I'd give her
another when she wakes up.

248
00:19:38,486 --> 00:19:42,043
Yeah, absolutely.
Fatten that baby up.

249
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:43,466
<i>Will do.</i>

250
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:50,563
Was that it?

251
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:53,531
So where are you.
Are you at work?

252
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,092
<i>Yeah, I'm at work.
I shouldn't be much longer.</i>

253
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:58,363
<i>Is that okay?</i>

254
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,504
You know I love my little Pookums.

255
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:02,867
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years

256
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,735
as far as I'm concerned.

257
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:06,552
Great.

258
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:08,259
Thanks, Marie.

259
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:14,205
Are you sure you're okay?

260
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:17,571
<i>Sweetie, what is it?</i>

261
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:19,575
<i>Come on.</i>

262
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:21,081
It's Hank.

263
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:23,979
<i>What about him?</i>

264
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,391
I don't know...

265
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,490
how to talk to him.

266
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:32,699
I don't know what to say to him anymore.
I don't know how to...

267
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:35,173
Ever since El Paso...

268
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:37,817
{\Ever since }<i>Maybe before...</i>

269
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:42,943
God knows
he went through a lot down there.

270
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,781
People blown up
right in front of him,

271
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:47,256
blood everywhere,

272
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:50,764
and last week

273
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:52,661
El Paso said they want him back.

274
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:57,082
He's not going. Steve Gomez is going
in his place, and...

275
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:01,313
I don't know how I feel about that.

276
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:05,508
Well, he's certainly
a lot safer up here, isn't he?

277
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:08,514
<i>Of course, and I want him safe.</i>

278
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,485
But I can't tell what he wants.

279
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:13,367
He won't talk to me.

280
00:21:14,193 --> 00:21:17,064
He hardly even comes home.
He works all day, all night.

281
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,682
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.

282
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:22,780
<i>It's like something's
eating him away from inside.</i>

283
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,939
He's just not the same.

284
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,285
He's not.

285
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:32,129
Facing death, it changes a person.
It has to, don't you think?

286
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:36,753
I guess
you've notice a change in Walt.

287
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:09,247
Please.

288
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:27,623
What is this?

289
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,851
Your new lab.

290
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,661
Thorium oxide...

291
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:27,407
for a catalyst bed.

292
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:33,574
Look at the size
of this reaction vessel.

293
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:35,636
Why, that's got...

294
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:37,761
that's got to be 1,200 liters.

295
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,944
Where...
How did you

296
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:46,663
know how to put this all together?

297
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,780
I had excellent help,

298
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:50,237
as will you.

299
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:56,200
Quite a lot of planning
went into this.

300
00:24:56,975 --> 00:24:58,225
I would say so.

301
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:03,166
The laundry upstairs...
I've owned it for years.

302
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:06,303
It receives large chemical
deliveries on a weekly basis...

303
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:07,814
detergents and such.

304
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,611
There is nothing suspicious
about it,

305
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:14,982
and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

306
00:25:17,188 --> 00:25:19,680
The filtration system
is state-of-the-art.

307
00:25:19,805 --> 00:25:22,705
It will vent nothing
but clean, odorless steam,

308
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:25,010
just as the laundry does,

309
00:25:25,135 --> 00:25:27,285
and through the very same stacks.

310
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,028
I need...

311
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,215
200 pounds per week

312
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:34,782
to make this economically viable.

313
00:25:36,424 --> 00:25:40,191
You would choose your own hours,
of course, come and go as you please

314
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:43,249
so long as the quota is met.

315
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,980
Sorry.

316
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,198
The answer is still no.

317
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:17,223
I have made a series of...

318
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:21,828
very bad decisions,
and I cannot make another one.

319
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:24,040
Why did you make these decisions?

320
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,257
For the good of my family.

321
00:26:27,264 --> 00:26:29,803
Then they weren't bad decisions.

322
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:35,262
What does a man do, Walter?

323
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:41,766
A man provides for his family.

324
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,355
This cost me my family.

325
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:47,793
When you have children,
you always have family.

326
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:50,596
They will always be your priority,
your responsibility,

327
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:52,561
and a man...

328
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,450
a man provides.

329
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:01,245
And he does it
even when he's not appreciated

330
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:03,537
or respected

331
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,313
or even loved.

332
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:10,930
He simply bears up,
and he does it...

333
00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:14,675
because he's a man.

334
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,540
{\pub}

335
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:36,416
Any chance
we could grab a quick bite?

336
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:39,859
Thai place
around the corner's pretty good.

337
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,965
I really gotta head home.

338
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:46,083
All right, rain check, then.

339
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:09,228
She said it was the tofu.

340
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:16,127
Whatever.
She's still cute anyways.

341
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,245
Great dinner, Mom.

342
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,625
Can I be excused?

343
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,608
To do homework
or to play videogames?

344
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,252
I can multitask.

345
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,801
Go ahead.

346
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:30,139
You want to take her?

347
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:43,829
Give me something, Andy.{\ Come on.}

348
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:54,865
Welded onto the back of a house.
That's classy.

349
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,321
Christ.

350
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,706
Hey, Janice. Janice.

351
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:20,252
The last one?

352
00:31:21,591 --> 00:31:23,479
Sorry, Hank.
That's all DMV had...

353
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:26,713
29 early '80s Bounders
registered in New Mexico.

354
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:28,761
Could you check again?

355
00:31:29,965 --> 00:31:30,965
Now?

356
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:33,516
Can I do it after the party?

357
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:34,884
Janice, I'm...

358
00:31:35,942 --> 00:31:37,269
I'm dead in the water here.

359
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:39,915
Okay, I'll check.

360
00:31:58,525 --> 00:31:59,525
Gomie,

361
00:32:00,783 --> 00:32:03,460
time for the little bird
to fly the nest, huh?

362
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,209
They got the right guy for the job,

363
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:08,509
especially since
the bean-speak comes natural{\ and all}.

364
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:11,336
Wanna know how to say
"Get bent" in Spanish?

365
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,839
Just don't go native on me,
all right?

366
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:23,254
Here.

367
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:27,516
Know your enemy and all.

368
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:37,913
Fight the good fight{\, brother}.

369
00:32:39,012 --> 00:32:40,012
I will.

370
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:44,357
What have we got to drink
around here?

371
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:55,180
Your hunch was right.

372
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,282
One more RV.

373
00:32:58,162 --> 00:33:00,452
DMV said the registration
wasn't renewed,

374
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:04,430
but then they realized it was never
filed as non-operational or destroyed.

375
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,524
No police report, either.

376
00:34:33,216 --> 00:34:36,766
I just don't know what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

377
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:39,782
It's like I'm paralyzed,

378
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:43,725
like if I take a step in any direction,
I'm going to make

379
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:46,386
a spectacular mistake.

380
00:34:48,936 --> 00:34:51,786
God, I could go
for a glass of wine about now.

381
00:34:53,162 --> 00:34:54,662
You want to go to...

382
00:34:55,252 --> 00:34:56,385
Sorry, never mind.

383
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:00,371
Anyway,

384
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:05,436
breaking news is
I am sleeping with my boss,

385
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,837
and I don't know why.

386
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:10,281
- Wow.
- Yep.

387
00:35:15,832 --> 00:35:17,057
That's a lie.

388
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:18,623
I do know why.

389
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:24,528
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

390
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:27,663
He's a really good person,

391
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:30,812
but, I mean, it's not like
we're ever gonna...

392
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:37,737
Somehow, and I can't
actually believe it, but

393
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,469
my entire family
sees me as some sort of...

394
00:35:44,698 --> 00:35:45,898
My own sister,

395
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:47,576
my brother-in-law.

396
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,180
My teenage son

397
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:51,877
tells me I'm a bitch.

398
00:35:54,104 --> 00:35:57,092
And you say tell him the truth.

399
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:00,366
Tell him about his father,

400
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:03,592
but I can't...

401
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:05,503
ever.

402
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:08,407
How could I?

403
00:36:08,844 --> 00:36:10,984
And this man that I'm seeing,
you know,

404
00:36:12,248 --> 00:36:13,588
as wrong as I know it is,

405
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,031
as much as I know I'm probably doing it
just to make Walt leave me,

406
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:21,059
it is the only thing in my day

407
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:23,141
where I don't feel...

408
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:27,381
like I'm...

409
00:36:30,363 --> 00:36:31,313
drowning.

410
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:38,609
So he knows about this other man?

411
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:42,679
So then he'll sign?

412
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:47,891
Walt says he's not going anywhere,

413
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:52,481
so that's a really brilliant
gambit on my part.

414
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:53,398
Yep.

415
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,330
Genius.

416
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:07,313
He keeps money in the house.

417
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:12,232
Your husband, the drug dealer?

418
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:13,794
How much money?

419
00:37:15,326 --> 00:37:17,030
I didn't count it.

420
00:37:17,155 --> 00:37:18,508
It's heavy.

421
00:37:20,684 --> 00:37:22,945
The bag where he keeps it.

422
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:29,184
Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

423
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,428
God, no.

424
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:33,671
No, I'm just, you know...

425
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:37,502
I'm just trying to just
talk it through. That's...

426
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,162
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified

427
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:42,150
and twice the price of a therapist.

428
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,175
There is nothing
to discuss here, Skyler.

429
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,641
I'm just saying, you know?

430
00:37:46,177 --> 00:37:47,577
We have a history.

431
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:51,188
He's the father of my children,

432
00:37:51,828 --> 00:37:54,347
and maybe what he did, he...

433
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,434
He did it for the family.
Right?

434
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:58,647
Guess what.

435
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:01,382
That is one enormous load
of horse shit.

436
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:02,739
Okay.

437
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,988
I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

438
00:38:06,695 --> 00:38:07,895
You are a fool

439
00:38:08,197 --> 00:38:10,747
to stay in that house
one minute longer.

440
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,762
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

441
00:38:14,183 --> 00:38:16,398
You are now an accessory
after the fact.

442
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:17,644
You are culpable.

443
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:21,003
You, your children,
you could lose everything you own.

444
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:22,528
Do you understand?

445
00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:26,208
All courtesy of this criminal

446
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,071
you refuse to divorce.

447
00:38:29,037 --> 00:38:30,622
I didn't marry a criminal.

448
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,933
You're married to one now.

449
00:39:51,888 --> 00:39:53,744
Let's run through
this thing one more time,

450
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,890
especially the part where I do all
the talking and you don't say jack?

451
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:58,613
Oh, I'm going to say jack.

452
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:00,083
I'm going to say plenty.

453
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:03,519
What did we say about escalating, huh?
Who's got your back here?

454
00:40:03,644 --> 00:40:05,904
Me. All right?
I'm going to take care of things.

455
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,325
Hey, what are the parameters
of this sobriety thing you got going?

456
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,591
- What do you mean?
- Can you take a Xanax?

457
00:40:11,716 --> 00:40:13,386
'Cause I got a drawer full of them.

458
00:40:14,326 --> 00:40:16,839
I get them from my "chiropractor."

459
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:19,502
Vietnamese, 5 foot tall,

460
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:22,204
she adjusts you to completion.

461
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,223
Her name's Kim Nu Suong,

462
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,525
as delicious as it sounds.

463
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:31,708
I should give you her card.

464
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,494
To hell with this.
I'm outta here.

465
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:36,029
<i>He's here.</i>

466
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:39,427
Send him in.

467
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,388
Hello, Walt.

468
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:47,177
Good to see you.

469
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:49,432
Please, have a seat...

470
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:50,864
here.

471
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:53,379
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

472
00:40:56,106 --> 00:40:57,371
You're late.

473
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:00,519
Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here.

474
00:41:00,644 --> 00:41:02,610
There's always a way to oil
everyone's lock.

475
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:04,779
This young man

476
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:07,298
is prepared to offer you
a sweetheart of a deal

477
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,594
doing precisely nothing.

478
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:11,164
Really?

479
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:15,072
10 percent of all future profits
from his solo venture

480
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:19,369
is money you get paid
for walking down to the mailbox.

481
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:22,555
Consider it a gesture of respect

482
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,247
for your valuable contributions
to the business thus far.

483
00:41:25,372 --> 00:41:27,612
I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.

484
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:30,816
That's charity, is what that is.

485
00:41:31,546 --> 00:41:32,946
I do all the work.

486
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:35,786
He sits around on his fat ass
judging people.

487
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:38,013
Escalating.

488
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,248
Stop.

489
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,425
Here's that,
but then there's one small detail.

490
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:47,258
Clearly a mistake was made
on the part of our mutual associate

491
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:49,660
when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

492
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,708
He must not have realized that you two
had come to a parting of the ways.

493
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,470
Take it.

494
00:41:54,907 --> 00:41:56,307
It belongs to you.

495
00:41:56,694 --> 00:41:58,886
You're damn right it belongs to me.

496
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:01,522
I knew I could count
on you boys to play nice.

497
00:42:01,647 --> 00:42:04,135
That almost brings a tear to my eye.

498
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,510
Enjoy it.
Spend it in good health.

499
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:11,643
That is the last money
you'll ever earn in this business.

500
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,064
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

501
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:21,063
I hate to break it to you, Jesse,
but our mutual associate

502
00:42:22,394 --> 00:42:23,867
was only using you

503
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,889
to get to me.

504
00:42:26,495 --> 00:42:27,825
What are you talking about?

505
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:31,605
You see, he needs someone
with expertise,

506
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:35,353
someone who knows what he's doing.

507
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:36,927
In other words,

508
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:38,784
he needs me.

509
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:41,776
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

510
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:43,855
Yeah, uh...

511
00:42:44,224 --> 00:42:45,503
How should I put this?

512
00:42:47,836 --> 00:42:48,686
I'm in.

513
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:51,667
You're out.

514
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:57,203
Walt, hold on there.

515
00:42:58,214 --> 00:43:00,653
What was the offer, if I may ask?

516
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:04,066
It's, uh, 3 million

517
00:43:04,984 --> 00:43:06,768
for three months of my time.

518
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,374
You're gonna need that money laundered,
right? I mean, of course.

519
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,959
What was our deal before?
17 percent. That's a shade high.

520
00:43:14,084 --> 00:43:17,315
Let's settle on an even 15.
That's a nice round number.

521
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:18,576
5 percent.

522
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,555
- 14's fair.
- 5.

523
00:43:20,773 --> 00:43:21,742
- 13.
- 5.

524
00:43:21,867 --> 00:43:23,266
12.
For old time's sake, 12.

525
00:43:24,091 --> 00:43:24,886
5.

526
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,858
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

527
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:31,207
10 even, but I can't go any lower
and still respect myself.

528
00:43:31,564 --> 00:43:32,356
5.

529
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,387
What in the hell just happened?
You're my lawyer, not his!

530
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,460
That's the way of the world, kid.

531
00:43:38,585 --> 00:43:40,166
You go with the winner.

532
00:43:40,478 --> 00:43:42,789
You think this'll stop me
from cooking?

533
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:44,532
Cook whatever you like...

534
00:43:44,657 --> 00:43:48,296
As long as it's that ridiculous
"Chili P" or some other dreck,

535
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,418
but don't even think
about using my formula.

536
00:43:52,202 --> 00:43:54,850
Just try and stop me, bitch.

537
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,578
Yes?

538
00:44:46,703 --> 00:44:48,301
Hi, there, Mrs. Ortega?

539
00:44:48,426 --> 00:44:49,218
Yes.

540
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:52,274
Hi, I'm Hank Schrader. I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

541
00:44:53,127 --> 00:44:54,483
We're interested in an RV

542
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,769
that's registered
to your name and address.

543
00:44:58,063 --> 00:44:59,463
Do you have an RV?

544
00:44:59,817 --> 00:45:00,617
I did.

545
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:02,721
It was stolen months ago.

546
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:04,877
Stolen, huh?

547
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:09,734
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

548
00:45:09,859 --> 00:45:12,909
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police or the DMV.

549
00:45:13,206 --> 00:45:15,640
I just...
didn't get around to it.

550
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,780
May I ask why?

551
00:45:19,267 --> 00:45:21,124
I mean, it's a great way to get

552
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,727
the family together
for an affordable vacation.

553
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:26,071
It must've been quite a blow
when it went missing.

554
00:45:26,196 --> 00:45:27,046
It was.

555
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:32,014
Do you have any ideas at all
who might've taken it?

556
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,499
I didn't want him arrested.

557
00:45:37,342 --> 00:45:39,042
He ran with a bad crowd,

558
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:41,511
but he was never a bad person.

559
00:45:42,669 --> 00:45:44,352
I thought he could
turn his life around.

560
00:45:44,477 --> 00:45:46,159
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

561
00:45:46,823 --> 00:45:47,673
My son.

562
00:45:49,326 --> 00:45:51,576
I'd really like to speak with him.

563
00:45:52,712 --> 00:45:54,014
He's passed away.

564
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:55,971
He was shot two months ago.

565
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:01,036
- What was your son's name?
- Christian.

566
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:02,511
Christian Ortega.

567
00:46:05,024 --> 00:46:07,002
Was his nickname "Combo"?

568
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,170
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.
