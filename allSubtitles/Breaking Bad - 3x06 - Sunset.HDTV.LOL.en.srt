1
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:07,487
<i>KDK-12, come in. KDK-12.</i>

2
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:09,222
KDK-12.

3
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:12,725
<i>Hey, Bobby, need you to look in on Mrs.
Peyketewa.</i>

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,827
She all right?

5
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:15,962
<i>Her daughter called
from California,</i>

6
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:17,497
<i>she hasn't heard
from her in a while,</i>

7
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,132
<i>kind of worried.</i>

8
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,633
Will do.

9
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,622
Miss Peyketewa, hello.

10
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:20,860
Miss Peyketewa.

11
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:31,538
Miss Peyketewa.

12
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,539
KDK-12 here.

13
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:15,642
Janet, Jesus,
we got a homicide.

14
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:17,644
<i>Come again?
Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.</i>

15
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:20,213
<i>I need some backup out here.
On their way.</i>

16
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:29,455
Whoever's in there,
show yourself right now.

17
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,602
Hold it right there!
Let me see your hands.

18
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:43,970
Hands!

19
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:48,574
All right, down.

20
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,009
On your knees.

21
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:53,546
You understand me?
Do you speak English?

22
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:00,420
I said down!
On your knees. Down!

23
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,292
Damn it, get down!
On your knees!

24
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:07,493
Do it!

25
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,598
On your knees or I'll fire!

26
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:30,768
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

27
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,977
Yeah.

28
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,512
<i>I found the papers.</i>

29
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:02,815
<i>Right where you left them,
in the crib.</i>

30
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,684
Yeah, well...

31
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:08,988
You know best, right?

32
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:10,590
Anything else?

33
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,325
<i>Do you have any thought</i>

34
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:17,897
about how we're going to
approach this with Walter Jr?

35
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:20,733
<i>Well, he's still my son.
I mean, he will remain--</i>

36
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,101
Of course.

37
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:26,806
<i>My point being the divorce.</i>

38
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:32,612
<i>Well, I--</i>

39
00:05:32,646 --> 00:05:34,714
I think he gets it.
Don't you?

40
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:38,885
I mean, I--

41
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,854
I think he saw it coming.

42
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,056
He sees your unhappiness
and--

43
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:45,491
<i>My unhappiness?</i>

44
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:48,961
<i>My completely
out-of-the-clear,</i>

45
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:52,031
blue-sky unhappiness?

46
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:55,401
<i>Really?</i>

47
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:58,371
Look, as you said,
for the best.

48
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:00,072
Yeah.

49
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:04,477
Okay, um, last thing,
and then I'll let you go.

50
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:08,414
<i>In the Child Support
Worksheet,</i>

51
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:10,683
<i>you list medical, dental,</i>

52
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,152
child care, transportation,

53
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:17,156
housing, education,
food, clothing.

54
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,758
That's right, all of it.

55
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,762
Walt...

56
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:24,096
No.

57
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:26,866
<i>Skyler, you wanted me out.</i>

58
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,002
I'm out, but I will
provide for my family.

59
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:32,138
<i>Not with that money.</i>

60
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:35,374
You'd be making us
accessories after the fact.

61
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,476
Skyler, how do you think
we've been paying our bills

62
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:39,278
these last six months?

63
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,985
I have to go.

64
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,420
Yep, I was right.

65
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,056
Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

66
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,791
I can call over, get you in

67
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:53,292
to see any of the others
if you'd like.

68
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:54,927
No. No, this one's fine.

69
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:57,296
I'll take it.

70
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,169
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the model, so--

71
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,770
Yeah, I like it.

72
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:07,573
I like everything about it.

73
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:10,610
I'll-- I'll take it as is.

74
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:14,814
Name one thing in this world

75
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,215
that is not negotiable.

76
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:25,591
Oh, Jesus.
You have to clean the fryer.

77
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:27,326
Yes, sir.

78
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:32,264
So we try to clean them
every night,

79
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:33,532
but make sure it's off

80
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:36,402
before you open
the intake valve.

81
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:37,470
Good.

82
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:39,472
Now, I suggest
that you add this

83
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,173
to your Monday
maintenance schedule.

84
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,582
Main valve on, main switch on.

85
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:52,218
Give the compressor time for
the needle to enter the green.

86
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,600
You're for real.
This is all you?

87
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,035
All me.

88
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,270
Heisenberg who?
That's what I say.

89
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:13,339
My man Jesse can cook.

90
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:16,842
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

91
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:18,144
Just the right shade of blue.

92
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:19,345
Good shade.

93
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,047
Check out that crystal size,
yo.

94
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,516
If that bitch was any bigger,
it would be a Jolly Rancher.

95
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,986
Be my guest.
Hit it.

96
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,589
You sure?

97
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:33,793
I feel kind of diggish with
you being in rehab and all.

98
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:37,596
No. I can watch, yo.

99
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,032
I can cook, and I can watch.

100
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,169
Go for it. I tried it, like, last week.
I'm still coming down.

101
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,571
Go easy.

102
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,841
Okay.

103
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:01,687
Ho-- whoa-- whoa.

104
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:07,059
<i>Whoo! Riverdance!</i>

105
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:10,796
Hey-- Hey, stop marking up
my floor, dumbass. Come on.

106
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:14,867
Whoa-- Whoa-- ooh!

107
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,335
Bow before me.

108
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:17,536
Wow.

109
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:19,939
I am Lord of the Dance.
Huh?

110
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:24,343
Shit.
I gotta try that again.

111
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,445
Uh, yeah, no,
I think you're good.

112
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,248
That is awesome, Jesse.

113
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:32,151
I feel like somebody took
my brain out

114
00:09:32,185 --> 00:09:35,187
and boiled it in, like,
boiling hot--

115
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:37,022
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

116
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:39,992
...like-- like anthrax.

117
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,027
Good.

118
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:44,029
So, um...

119
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,998
You ready to talk
some business?

120
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:51,170
You mean, this is not, like, just...
recreational?

121
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:57,143
Uh-uh. I know
what you're thinking.

122
00:09:57,177 --> 00:10:00,546
Trust me. It's not going
to be like it was--

123
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,282
all right,
never gonna be like it was.

124
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:05,718
How's that?
We sell it safe.

125
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:08,220
All right? We sell it smart.

126
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,456
We don't get greedy...

127
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,557
Like before.

128
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:14,326
I don't know, man.

129
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:16,228
Combo and all.

130
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:26,205
Still.

131
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:29,208
Man's gotta make his living.

132
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,177
If it's like Jesse says

133
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,913
and we're not greedy...

134
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:37,683
I mean, I guess I can see it.

135
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:39,685
Had a good thing going before
we started pushing our luck.

136
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,853
Yeah.

137
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:43,189
If it can go back to being
like that and all--

138
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:44,557
Hey, it will be.

139
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:47,393
Step 1--
we build inventory.

140
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:48,794
Badger, go see Clovis.

141
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:51,730
Get the RV in shape--
tune up, oil change,

142
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,532
brake lights, and whatnot.

143
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,734
Cops always pull you over
for brake lights.

144
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,469
Not us.

145
00:10:57,504 --> 00:10:58,604
Cautious.

146
00:10:58,638 --> 00:10:59,905
You got it.

147
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,474
All right,
you know that buzzer thing.

148
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:04,610
Leave the key in the ignition,
and it buzzes, whatever.

149
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:08,013
Yeah. Just have him put
in one of those, too.

150
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,316
Skinny, you're
in charge of supplies.

151
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,685
I'll get you a list.

152
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,320
Right on.

153
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,455
Yeah?

154
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:18,657
Yeah.
Let's do this. All right.

155
00:11:20,594 --> 00:11:23,629
So, uh... we good?

156
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:24,697
Yeah.
We good?

157
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:25,865
Right on, man.
All right.

158
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,001
Let's do this thing.

159
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:45,017
Brandon Mayhew.

160
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,752
I know you.

161
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,623
Small world, Albuquerque.

162
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,770
Want to talk about it?

163
00:12:53,804 --> 00:12:56,406
Why? It's not like
I get a vote.

164
00:12:59,476 --> 00:13:01,177
You know, ironically,

165
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:05,715
I think you're going to see
much more of me from now on.

166
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:09,586
- Sure.
- Well, just as much of me at least.

167
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,455
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

168
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:15,058
What, I don't get a vote
in this, either?

169
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:16,859
I gotta stop going with Louis

170
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:19,229
just because
you're feeling guilty?

171
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,566
I do feel guilty.

172
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:31,941
I am the man that I am, son,

173
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:34,978
and there's plenty I would
change about that, but...

174
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,249
Here we are

175
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:42,218
and this is just what it is.

176
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:50,393
You know what?

177
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:54,530
Call me crazy, but I'm actually
feeling very good about the future.

178
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,734
Morning.

179
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:34,737
They're back.

180
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:36,306
Uh, I'm just wondering

181
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,808
if we should maybe call
the police or something.

182
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,777
Why?

183
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,879
They're doing nothing wrong.

184
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:50,586
Okay, let's put this
on table 33, okay?

185
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:17,340
Hello, there.

186
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:21,344
Uh, Mr. White, I presume?

187
00:16:21,378 --> 00:16:24,881
Oh, yes. Hi.
I am-- Sorry.

188
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:27,483
I'll be right down.

189
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:39,262
Hi. Gale Boetticher.

190
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,930
Hi.

191
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:44,434
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

192
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:45,902
Yes, I am.

193
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:48,638
I suppose you'll want
to hear my qualifications.

194
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:51,307
I have my, uh--
my resume here for you.

195
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,479
I received
my bachelor's degree from UNM,

196
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:59,215
my master's from
the University of Colorado.

197
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:03,152
Organic chemistry
with a specialty in--

198
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:04,787
It's all right there.

199
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:08,057
"X-ray crystallography."

200
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:09,392
Really.

201
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:13,463
I could talk about that
for hours.

202
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:15,965
I would love to.

203
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:18,634
Well, first,
I'm curious about this.

204
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,974
That's a little pet project
of mine.

205
00:17:25,008 --> 00:17:26,342
Hm.

206
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,910
See, in my opinion,

207
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,780
it's all about
the quinic acid level.

208
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:34,851
You want just north
of 4,800 milligrams per liter,

209
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:36,819
but if you over-boil
to get there,

210
00:17:36,854 --> 00:17:38,488
you're going to leach
your tannins.

211
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:41,090
Bitterness. Yuck.

212
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,392
So I pull a mild vacuum.

213
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:48,297
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C, and uh...

214
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:53,169
Let's see.

215
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:56,105
Judge for yourself.

216
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:10,319
Oh, my God.

217
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:21,197
My God, that is the best
coffee I've ever tasted.

218
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,968
Sumatran beans,

219
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:28,004
and I also have to give
credit to the grind,

220
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:30,973
but, uh, thank you,
Mr. White.

221
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:32,775
Walt, please.

222
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:34,343
Call me Walt.

223
00:18:34,378 --> 00:18:37,246
Huh, why the hell
are we making meth?

224
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:53,889
Tell me, with the phenylacetic
acid solution,

225
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:58,427
you said 150 drops per minute
for the first 10 minutes,

226
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,562
and then 90 for the remainder.

227
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:02,398
Why is that?

228
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:05,668
Well, my thinking is,

229
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:11,674
by tapering the phenyl, you get an
oilier aqueous layer, and hence--

230
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,109
Better benzene extraction.

231
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,011
Exactly.

232
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:18,347
But actually I prefer ether.

233
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:20,316
Oh. I'll have it
for tomorrow.

234
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:31,160
Gale, I'm wondering how you--

235
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:33,262
Ended up here.

236
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:36,165
Well, actually,
I'm still wondering

237
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:39,802
how I ended up here, but, yes.

238
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:41,904
I mean, I can't imagine

239
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:44,239
we strike each other
as criminals.

240
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:48,644
Well, there's crime,

241
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:52,147
and then there's crime,
I suppose.

242
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,184
I'm definitely a libertarian.

243
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,987
Consenting adults
want what they want,

244
00:20:58,021 --> 00:20:59,488
and if I'm not supplying it,

245
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:01,890
they will get it
somewhere else.

246
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,727
At least with me, they're getting
exactly what they pay for.

247
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:08,230
No added toxins or adulterants.

248
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:13,902
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to,

249
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:15,738
pursuing my doctorate
at Colorado,

250
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,206
NSF research grant.

251
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,575
I was on my way,

252
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,611
jumping through hoops,
kissing the proper behinds,

253
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:25,981
attending
to allhe non-chemistry

254
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:28,350
that one finds oneself
occupied with.

255
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:30,119
You know that world.

256
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:33,022
That is not
what I signed on for.

257
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:40,195
I love the lab.

258
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,298
Because it's all still magic.

259
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,800
You know?

260
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:49,772
Chemistry?

261
00:21:49,806 --> 00:21:54,109
I mean, on you lose that...

262
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:58,080
It is. It is magic.

263
00:21:58,114 --> 00:22:00,682
It still is.

264
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:04,086
And all the while
I kept thinking

265
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,088
about that great,
old Whitman poem.

266
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,591
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

267
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:11,160
Walt Whitman.

268
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:12,694
I-- I don't know it.

269
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:14,463
Uh, anyway...

270
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:15,864
Well, can you recite it?

271
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:22,371
Pathetically enough I could.

272
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:24,606
All right, well...

273
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:27,142
No, no, come on.
Come on.

274
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:28,410
Yeah?

275
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:36,251
When I heard
the learn'd astronomer;

276
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:39,354
When the proofs, the figures,

277
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:42,124
were ranged in columns
before me;

278
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:44,993
When I was shown the charts
and the diagrams,

279
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:47,963
to add, divide,
and measure them;

280
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:51,400
When I, sitting, heard the
astronomer, where he lectured

281
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:55,304
with much applause
in the lecture-room,

282
00:22:55,338 --> 00:23:01,243
How soon, unaccountable,
I became tired and sick;

283
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:03,745
Till rising and gliding out,

284
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,014
I wander'd off by myself,

285
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:10,119
In the mystical moist
night-air,

286
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:11,787
and from time to time,

287
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:14,423
Look'd up in perfect silence

288
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:16,391
at the stars.

289
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:26,935
Yes, I am a nerd.

290
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:32,407
Bravo.
Thank you.

291
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,079
Come on, Pinkman.

292
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:39,414
You little rat bastard.

293
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:41,950
Get off your lazy ass
and go bream the law.

294
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:19,454
Hey, baby.

295
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:21,256
<i>Are you ever coming home?</i>

296
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:22,958
Marie, I'm working.
All right?

297
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:24,660
<i>Did you find it? The RV?</i>

298
00:24:24,694 --> 00:24:28,397
<i>Nope. Working on it, so...</i>

299
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,032
Why can't you just arrest him,

300
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,266
make him tell you?

301
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:33,569
<i>It's not that simple, baby.</i>

302
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,304
<i>There's a little thing
called The Constitution.</i>

303
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:37,406
The Constitution, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

304
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:43,745
<i>This kid, I swear to God,
I wish I just could--</i>

305
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:48,050
This is that Pinkman character?

306
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:49,718
<i>That's the one.</i>

307
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:51,720
<i>Positive the little bastard
has got an RV,</i>

308
00:24:51,754 --> 00:24:54,256
and I just don't know
where he keeps it.

309
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,124
Until he actually leads me
to where--

310
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,261
or does something,
I'm stuck here, Marie,

311
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:01,997
so... sorry.

312
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:05,968
Well, um... not to bring up
ancient history,

313
00:25:06,002 --> 00:25:09,871
but I for one can think of someone
who might know something...

314
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:13,242
Possibly.

315
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:14,743
It's worth a shot.

316
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:16,979
Yeah?

317
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,681
Who?

318
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:24,753
Hello.

319
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:26,488
<i>Oh, hey, buddy.
Hey, how you doing?</i>

320
00:25:26,522 --> 00:25:28,690
Oh, hey, Hank.
What's up?

321
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:30,058
<i>Listen, I hate to bother you.</i>

322
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:32,361
<i>I just-- I just, uh--
I just have a quick question.</i>

323
00:25:32,395 --> 00:25:33,996
Oh, shoot.

324
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,164
<i>Now, I'm only asking you this
because I'm at a, you know,</i>

325
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,066
dead-end here potentially.

326
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:41,370
I'm working a case,
and, uh--

327
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:45,774
Listen, you gotta know that I
would never put you on the spot

328
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:47,276
<i>or make you uncomfortable.</i>

329
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,045
Hank, you could just
cut to the chase.

330
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,115
Back when we lost you

331
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:54,883
and I was trying
to track you down

332
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:57,252
<i>through a former student
of yours, Jesse Pinkman,</i>

333
00:25:57,287 --> 00:26:00,289
<i>now, you know that I know</i>

334
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:02,891
that once upon a time he may
have dealt you a little weed.

335
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:04,660
Hank--

336
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:07,829
<i>Just a little, and I so
do not care about that.</i>

337
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:10,265
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled, okay?

338
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,034
<i>Like you said,
cut to the chase.</i>

339
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:14,870
<i>Do you remember
if this Pinkman kid</i>

340
00:26:14,904 --> 00:26:16,872
<i>ever had an RV?</i>

341
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:22,844
<i>You know,
a recreational vehicle,</i>

342
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:25,180
<i>you know,
like a Winnebago-type deal,</i>

343
00:26:25,214 --> 00:26:28,183
brown and beige?

344
00:26:28,217 --> 00:26:31,353
Uh, why?

345
00:26:31,387 --> 00:26:33,422
<i>Well, it's a long story,</i>

346
00:26:33,456 --> 00:26:35,691
<i>but I'm personally of the opinion
that he's moved on from weed</i>

347
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:38,093
<i>and graduated to selling
crystal meth,</i>

348
00:26:38,127 --> 00:26:40,729
<i>using it as a rolling lab.</i>

349
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:48,203
Walt?

350
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:04,837
Yo.

351
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:10,509
What? Mr. White.

352
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,862
<i>Hey, how's my favorite genius?</i>

353
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,263
Is this a secure line?

354
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:33,232
<i>Is this a secure--</i>

355
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:34,500
<i>Yes, what's with the--</i>

356
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:36,068
Hey, hello to you, too.

357
00:27:36,102 --> 00:27:38,704
<i>Listen, we've got a problem,
a DEA problem.</i>

358
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:39,939
Okay, I'm listening.

359
00:27:39,973 --> 00:27:42,608
<i>My brother-in-law,
he knows about the RV.</i>

360
00:27:42,642 --> 00:27:43,943
What RV?

361
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:45,411
Our RV,

362
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:47,580
the one which contains
a meth lab,

363
00:27:47,614 --> 00:27:48,848
<i>which is covered
with my fingerprints.</i>

364
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:50,182
<i>Ring a bell?</i>

365
00:27:50,217 --> 00:27:52,084
Okay, what exactly does
"knows about" mean?

366
00:27:52,118 --> 00:27:53,786
Does he have it?
Has he searched it?

367
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,522
No, he knows it exists,
and he's trying to find it.

368
00:27:56,556 --> 00:27:57,756
<i>He has linked it to Jesse,</i>

369
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,024
<i>and it's only a matter of time</i>

370
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,759
<i>before he tracks it down,
so--</i>

371
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:03,362
<i>So get rid of it. What are you doing
sitting here talking to me for?</i>

372
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:05,531
<i>Better yet,
have Pinkman get rid of it.</i>

373
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,299
<i>Right? You don't go near it.</i>

374
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:08,667
No, no, listen,
my brother-in-law,

375
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:10,369
he is surveying Jesse's house.

376
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:12,471
<i>Do you understand?
So he might've tapped the phones</i>

377
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:14,039
<i>or bugged his house.</i>

378
00:28:14,074 --> 00:28:15,574
<i>Jesus. Plan A, then.</i>

379
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,376
Go. Get to it
before the feds do.

380
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,713
And do what exactly?

381
00:28:20,747 --> 00:28:22,882
I mean, what--

382
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:26,819
The thing-- The thing
is the size of a--

383
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:28,320
It's RV size.

384
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:31,056
<i>I mean, where do I go
to make an RV disappear?</i>

385
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:32,591
I'm not David Copperfield.

386
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:33,859
<i>What do I look like,</i>

387
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:35,594
the RV disposal people?

388
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:36,729
Did you not plan

389
00:28:36,763 --> 00:28:38,731
<i>for this contingency?
No.</i>

390
00:28:38,765 --> 00:28:40,599
Well, next time,
plan for it, would you?

391
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:43,035
<i>The Starship Enterprise
had a self-destruct button.</i>

392
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:45,804
I'm just saying.
Okay, oh, shut up.

393
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,640
I'm just saying, you know,

394
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:49,241
you're good with tools and all.

395
00:28:49,276 --> 00:28:54,446
Why don't you invent a
water-powered car, you know?

396
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:56,682
If you did that,
you would be rolling in it.

397
00:28:58,685 --> 00:29:00,352
Socket wrench.

398
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,620
The big one.

399
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,790
What?

400
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:06,458
You scared of the Arabs?

401
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:15,467
Are you out of your mind?
Why is this out in the open?

402
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:16,735
Who the hell are you?

403
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,870
He's-- He's Heisenberg.

404
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:19,004
Is this drivable?
Does it run?

405
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,306
Yeah, I was just
changing the oil.

406
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,740
Well, finish it, quickly.

407
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:24,009
We'll wipe it clean
and take it out to the desert.

408
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:25,311
Come here and help me.

409
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:27,680
Hold up.
What's this about?

410
00:29:27,714 --> 00:29:29,648
The DEA,

411
00:29:29,683 --> 00:29:31,250
the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

412
00:29:31,284 --> 00:29:32,451
You've heard of them,
haven't you?

413
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:33,519
I know you have.

414
00:29:33,553 --> 00:29:35,254
They know all about this RV,

415
00:29:35,288 --> 00:29:37,156
and they're trying
to find it right now.

416
00:29:38,925 --> 00:29:40,492
I want this
off my property now.

417
00:29:40,527 --> 00:29:43,095
No, no, no, no, no, we have
got to destroy the evidence.

418
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,230
We've got to rig this thing to burn.
Do you understand?

419
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:47,199
Not here you don't.
Just get it the hell out of here.

420
00:29:47,233 --> 00:29:49,401
Now, listen to me.
I need your help, okay?

421
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:51,270
If I go down, we all go down.

422
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:52,738
Do you understand?

423
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,142
All right, just--
I know a better way.

424
00:29:57,177 --> 00:29:59,745
I know a guy that'll wipe this off
the planet, no questions asked.

425
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,180
Call him.

426
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:08,954
Hey, what about Jesse?

427
00:30:08,989 --> 00:30:10,222
What about him?

428
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,468
Hey, it's me.

429
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:23,836
Wanna hear something weird?

430
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,637
Now, listen to me.

431
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:28,607
You get that address.
Now, Badger, I don't care how!

432
00:30:28,641 --> 00:30:30,743
You find out
where he's taking it!

433
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:36,248
Oh, yeah.

434
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:57,603
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

435
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:13,685
Excuse me, gentlemen.

436
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,121
This booth
is for paying customers.

437
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:17,890
Cynthia, it's okay.

438
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:20,392
I'll handle this.

439
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:58,397
96, 97, 98,

440
00:31:58,431 --> 00:32:00,499
99, 100.

441
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:02,601
Beyond recovery, right?

442
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:04,403
Now, beyond recovery means--
I get it.

443
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:05,971
Beyond recovery.

444
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:08,740
Obliterated, no evidence.
Hey, don't worry.

445
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:11,710
When we're through with it, it's
going to be about yea big, okay?

446
00:32:11,744 --> 00:32:13,745
Then we flatbed it
over to Long Beach,

447
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,747
ship it across the Pacific.

448
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:18,283
Chinese turn it
into patio furniture,

449
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:21,753
so... mind at ease.

450
00:32:21,788 --> 00:32:23,355
Listen, can you do me a favor?

451
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:25,424
I'm obviously going to need
a ride.

452
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,558
Could you call a cab?

453
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:28,594
You got it.
Pleasure doing business.

454
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:30,195
Thank you.
I'll be right behind you.

455
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,431
I just need to...

456
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:47,513
God.

457
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,871
The hell you think you're doing?
Me?

458
00:33:12,906 --> 00:33:14,773
No, this is mine
just as much as yours!

459
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:16,742
You don't get to just--
Oh, God. Oh, God.

460
00:33:16,776 --> 00:33:18,143
What?

461
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:22,748
God, they're out--

462
00:33:22,782 --> 00:33:23,982
What?

463
00:33:25,618 --> 00:33:27,719
He's here.

464
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:29,521
Who's here?

465
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:33,959
Holy--

466
00:33:33,993 --> 00:33:36,195
Oh, no.

467
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,168
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

468
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:44,636
You led him right to us.

469
00:35:05,198 --> 00:35:06,766
Shit.

470
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,568
Mr. Pinkman, you want
to add resisting arrest?

471
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:11,971
We'll add it.
No skin off my ass.

472
00:35:13,273 --> 00:35:15,341
Last chance to do it
the easy way.

473
00:35:55,882 --> 00:35:58,083
Got a warrant?

474
00:35:58,118 --> 00:35:59,985
Who are you?

475
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,555
Who are you? What do you
know about this RV?

476
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:04,957
Well, I'm the owner
of this lot,

477
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:08,527
which means you're trespassing
on private property.

478
00:36:08,562 --> 00:36:09,962
As far as the RV goes,

479
00:36:09,996 --> 00:36:11,564
seems to me it's locked,

480
00:36:11,598 --> 00:36:13,199
which means you're trying
to break and enter,

481
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:14,466
so I say again,

482
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:16,402
you got a warrant?

483
00:36:16,436 --> 00:36:20,139
Well, I don't need
one if I've got probable cause,

484
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:21,207
counselor.

485
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,842
Probable cause

486
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,177
usually relates to vehicles,
is my understanding,

487
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:27,813
you know, traffic stops
and whatnot.

488
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:30,482
See these round rubber things?

489
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:32,418
Wheels.

490
00:36:32,452 --> 00:36:33,819
This is a vehicle.

491
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:37,623
This is a domicile,
a residence,

492
00:36:37,657 --> 00:36:41,093
and thus protected
by the Fourth Amendment

493
00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:42,428
from unlawful search
and seizure.

494
00:36:42,462 --> 00:36:44,096
Look buddy, why don't you
just go out and--

495
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,198
Did you see this drive in here?

496
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:47,499
How do you know it runs?

497
00:36:47,534 --> 00:36:50,569
Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

498
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:53,606
It seems to me you're just out here...
fishing.

499
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:58,577
Don't see that holding up
in a court of law.

500
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:03,849
Oh, yeah?

501
00:37:03,884 --> 00:37:05,251
Well, look at these.

502
00:37:08,355 --> 00:37:10,155
What do those look like to you?

503
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,125
They sure look
like bullet holes to me.

504
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,796
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this "domicile."

505
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:19,632
Willing to bet there's
a judge or two out there

506
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:21,767
who'd see that as probable
cause, but I'll tell you what.

507
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:23,602
Why don't you call
the Albuquerque police--

508
00:37:23,637 --> 00:37:25,838
How could you have
known that they were there

509
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:28,941
before you took off the tape?

510
00:37:28,975 --> 00:37:30,342
What?

511
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:32,912
How could you have known
that they were there

512
00:37:32,946 --> 00:37:34,580
before you took off the tape?

513
00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:36,815
Say it. Say it.

514
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:43,188
How could you have known that they were
there before you took off the tape?

515
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:45,491
That's right.

516
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:49,161
Probable cause needs
to be readily apparent.

517
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:50,896
Huh.

518
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:53,032
There's somebody in there.

519
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:54,333
...private domicile
and I won't be harassed.

520
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:55,601
Yeah, I'll tell
you what, Pinkman.

521
00:37:55,635 --> 00:37:58,604
Probable cause or no,
I'll give you three seconds

522
00:37:58,638 --> 00:38:00,739
to get your ass out here.

523
00:38:00,774 --> 00:38:02,541
1, 2--

524
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:06,578
This is my own private domicile,
and I will not be harassed.

525
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:08,514
Bitch.

526
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:13,919
Oh, yeah.

527
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:20,559
Fine. You want your warrant?

528
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:24,296
I'll have my guys
bring it out here

529
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:26,165
and deliver it to you
on a little satin pillow.

530
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,366
How's that?

531
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,304
I waited this long.
Wait a little longer.

532
00:38:52,826 --> 00:38:54,426
Hey, Vicky.

533
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:56,095
Yeah, Schrader.
Give me Merkert, will you?

534
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:09,842
You know, I say--

535
00:39:09,876 --> 00:39:13,245
I say we just ram him.
All right?

536
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:14,446
I mean, we, uh--

537
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:17,950
we-- we start her up

538
00:39:17,984 --> 00:39:20,352
and just ram the shit
out of his truck.

539
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:22,488
We make our escape. Right?

540
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:30,062
Yeah, he'd, uh--

541
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:32,431
he'd shoot me in the head.

542
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:35,701
Yeah, he'd shoot me
in the head.

543
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:40,105
So what do we do, man, huh?

544
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,340
What do we--

545
00:39:41,374 --> 00:39:43,542
What?

546
00:39:45,045 --> 00:39:47,046
Please tell me

547
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,881
you got something.

548
00:39:54,421 --> 00:39:56,088
Yeah, I got something.

549
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:10,869
It's me.

550
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:12,638
We need your help.

551
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:36,428
Yeah.

552
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:39,465
<i>Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?</i>

553
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:41,166
Yeah. Who's this?

554
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:44,736
<i>Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner
with the Albuquerque Police.</i>

555
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:46,472
<i>Is your wife Marie Schrader?</i>

556
00:40:46,506 --> 00:40:48,807
Yes, why?

557
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:52,111
<i>I'm sorry to inform you that your
wife's been in an automobile accident.</i>

558
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:54,746
<i>She's being airlifted
to Los Ranchos Medical Center</i>

559
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:59,017
<i>and should be arriving there
shortly.</i>

560
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:00,786
How is she?
What's her condition?

561
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,688
<i>I don't, um...</i>

562
00:41:02,722 --> 00:41:04,656
<i>have the most current
information, sir,</i>

563
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:07,092
<i>but I think you might want to
get there as soon as possible.</i>

564
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:11,830
You're going to have
to start paying me more.

565
00:42:09,122 --> 00:42:11,089
<i>Marie?
I'm just checking in.</i>

566
00:42:11,124 --> 00:42:12,591
<i>I'd love to have some idea</i>

567
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,627
<i>of whether I should
cook dinner or not.</i>

568
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:16,929
Are you okay?

569
00:42:16,963 --> 00:42:19,631
<i>Yeah. Why?</i>

570
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:26,538
<i>Hank? What's up?</i>

571
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:37,382
