00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:04,796
So where have you been this time?

3
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:07,841
You gotta check out this crime scene

4
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:11,049
Guess they pissed off the wrong guy.

5
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:13,573
Tuco killing Gonzo
means he's coming after us next.

6
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:16,391
I've gotta get home. My family.

7
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:19,561
- Who is Jesse Pinkman?
- He sells me pot.

8
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,122
What the hell are you doing here ?

9
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:28,123
Get in !

12
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:06,028
All right, everybody.
Listen up.

13
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:07,863
Tuco Salamanca.

14
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:13,043
For those of you not with us this
morning, we raided his headquarters.

15
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,266
Also his last known address.

16
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:19,425
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth hag girlfriend.

17
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,416
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The big man himself smelled us coming.

18
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,541
So...

19
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:26,095
Study the face.

20
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,566
Study the file.

21
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,504
Get a big ol'raging hard on

22
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:33,747
at the idea of catching
this piece of shit.

23
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:36,837
My apologies to the HR department.

24
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,817
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

25
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:41,813
All right.

26
00:02:42,536 --> 00:02:44,570
On the hit parade, 1998.

27
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:48,517
Reputed to have whacked "Dog" Paulson,
back when our home-grown banditos

28
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:51,329
where wrestling the crank trade away
from the So Cal biker gangs.

29
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:54,673
Also, we're pretty sure he knifed
a Mexican national in '03.

30
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:58,562
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals,

31
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,753
I'd say he is a prime suspect

32
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,640
in the disappearance
of our dearly-missed Krazy-8.

33
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,918
Hats over your heart
for that dirtball.

34
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:09,081
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that one,

35
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,885
but as usual,
we couldn't make it stick.

36
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,316
He runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

37
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:17,362
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

38
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:20,826
I know it's...
We all know what's going on down there.

39
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,956
We sure as hell don't
want it going on up here.

40
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,912
Which brings us to the good news.

41
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:28,660
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

42
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:33,400
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name, No Doze.

43
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:37,276
Found him tucked in the junkyard,
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law,

44
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:38,851
A.K.A. Gonzo.

45
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:41,470
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,

46
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,435
was moving No Doze's body,

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,849
either hiding it there
or pulling it out, still not sure,

48
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:48,895
when he got his arm
crushed clean off.

49
00:03:49,856 --> 00:03:53,010
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my Web site. Hilarious.

50
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:56,333
Anyway. The upshot is,
we got us a nice,

51
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,871
big, juicy, bloody fingerprint,

52
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,323
which belongs to <i>señor</i> Tuco.

53
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:07,235
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

54
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:10,529
That is, provided we find this guy.

55
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,160
So to all present,

56
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,629
I ask you, you wanna find this guy?

57
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:19,448
What the hell was that?
Jesus.

58
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:21,303
Wanna try that again?

59
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:23,595
Do you want to find this guy?

60
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,973
Are we going to find this guy?

61
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:28,975
Louder, damn it!

62
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:31,609
- Give me a hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah!

63
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:42,815
They ain't gonna find him.

64
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,908
Guy's in Mexico by now.

65
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:48,065
Appearances, Gomie.
It's all about appearances.

66
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:52,457
Listen,
I gotta take some personal time.

67
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,376
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

68
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:59,295
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

69
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,342
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

70
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,646
Damn. You don't think he...

71
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:11,915
- Holler if you need me.
- Thanks a lot, man. Appreciate that.

72
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,363
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so...

73
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:30,672
But that's what he looks like now.

74
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:32,741
Without the hair.

75
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:36,715
Hey, it's me.

76
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,899
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate
you sparing us your day off.

77
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,362
No worries. Happy to help.

78
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,869
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

79
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:48,655
- What about height and weight?
- Five eleven...

80
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,742
most recently, about 170.

81
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:54,909
165. That's what I weigh.

82
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,706
I guess...

83
00:06:57,295 --> 00:07:00,252
- he weighs a little less.
- That's fine. That's close enough.

84
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,490
Good.

85
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:04,438
What about other
distinguishing features?

86
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:06,972
Tattoos or moles or scars?

87
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:09,797
- Anything that might help us...
- Tattoos?

88
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,375
Not really.

89
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:13,778
That's fine.

90
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:17,142
- Is that the list of medications?
- Yes. I wrote them all down.

91
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:20,014
And there's no drug interactions.
None that are listed.

92
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,232
I called his doctor, so, no.

93
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:24,888
Has he been depressed?

94
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,661
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

95
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,431
Last night, he was...

96
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:40,959
agitated.

97
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:42,561
Agitated.

98
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:45,105
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was...

99
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,840
agitated, upset.

100
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:50,677
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

101
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:58,501
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said...

102
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:01,980
"I don't know where to begin."

103
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:06,115
Then he just walked out
of the bathroom...

104
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,982
I was in the tub. Taking a bath.

105
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:10,947
And when I came out about ten
minutes later, he was gone.

106
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,804
Nothing else missing?

107
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:18,399
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

108
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,564
What about the phone call?

109
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,795
I'm looking into it.

110
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,371
What phone call?

111
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:32,052
Walt's cell phone rang.
He pulled it out,

112
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:34,949
looked at it, and didn't answer it.

113
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:38,391
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

114
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,018
I mean...

115
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,339
couldn't that be...

116
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:44,356
important, right?

117
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:49,861
Anything else you can think of?

118
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:52,404
Anything else.

119
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:55,336
I called the credit card providers,

120
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:57,282
and there's no report

121
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,748
of any recent activity.

122
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,897
Let's see...
I checked with every hospital

123
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:07,129
within 50 miles.
Every police station. Every morgue.

124
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:09,881
So, no, I really don't...
I don't have anything else.

125
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:13,208
I was actually hoping
that you had something else,

126
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,956
being that you're the expert.

127
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:23,447
- I'm sorry.
- No worries.

128
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:27,065
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

129
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:33,966
Thank you.

130
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:47,382
So that cell phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

131
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:50,633
- And?
- Never happened. No record of it.

132
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,216
- Second cell phone.
- Yeah. I'm thinkin'...

133
00:11:34,513 --> 00:11:35,840
I understand.

134
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:39,982
Out!

135
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:43,152
Get away from me!

136
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:46,910
Settle down, bitch!

137
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,200
You gonna shoot me?

138
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,444
Shoot me in here!

139
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:55,114
I hope I bleed like a mother, too!

140
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,999
That way, you have to clean it up!

141
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:04,423
It's your ride, retard.
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now get out!

142
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,919
Get up!

143
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:18,866
Get up.

144
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:31,666
Don't do this, Tuco.

145
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,534
No more posters?

146
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,812
Walter Junior's making more.

147
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:06,242
Thank you, Marie.

148
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,392
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

149
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:16,501
I mean, he just doesn't
strike me as the type.

150
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,974
He'll turn up.

151
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:31,107
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

152
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,732
I just find it bewildering that...

153
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:36,860
you didn't believe that...

154
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:40,902
Not now.

155
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:15,466
Empty your pockets.

156
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:46,311
Thought your name was Heisenberg,

157
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,096
"Walter Hartwell White."

158
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:52,669
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

159
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:57,212
A business name.

160
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,066
I like doing business
with a family man.

161
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,527
There's always a lot of collateral.

162
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:53,194
Answer me one thing.

163
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:58,246
Can I trust you?

164
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:02,703
Yes, absolutely.

165
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,238
Sit down.

166
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,586
DEA...

167
00:18:26,945 --> 00:18:28,849
hit my place
of business this morning.

168
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:31,935
About a hundred cops looking for me.

169
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:35,821
You two haven't been talking, right?

170
00:18:40,215 --> 00:18:43,184
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

171
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,820
Everybody except Gonzo.

172
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,321
That's weird, right?

173
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:49,870
I mean,

174
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:52,289
don't you think that that's weird?

175
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,720
That's weird. Yes.

176
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:56,619
Unusual.

177
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,746
Unusual.

178
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:01,842
Last two days,

179
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:05,260
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

180
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:09,681
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No Doze.

181
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:12,778
Explain to me,

182
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,365
how is it my fault

183
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,603
that that little bitch
did not know his place?

184
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,056
I saw this coming.

185
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:31,089
I can see the future, you know?

186
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:33,539
It's this gift that I have

187
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:35,958
deep inside my head.

188
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,256
I knew last night they were going
to come and try and bust me. Gonzo...

189
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,839
He went and snitched to the cops!

190
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,763
That lousy son of a bitch!

191
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:52,849
I trusted him like a brother!

192
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:56,303
I was good to him!
I was good!

193
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:59,459
I see Gonzo, I'm going to gut him,

194
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,174
I'm going to skin him,

195
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:04,249
and I'm going to stuff
his hide for a heavy bag,

196
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,535
and every time I hit him,

197
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,812
it's going to be like
a lesson to myself!

198
00:20:08,937 --> 00:20:12,395
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

199
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:22,639
So, you plan to ice Gonzo,

200
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:24,589
like, future tense?

201
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:26,758
What?

202
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,516
You're saying...

203
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:31,851
You're saying that...

204
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:35,207
Gonzo is currently...

205
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,895
operating as a police informant,
as far as you know?

206
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,431
I'm very sorry to hear that.

207
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,328
That's disappointing.

208
00:20:49,324 --> 00:20:52,284
- I'd waste him, too, yo.
- Shut up.

209
00:20:54,342 --> 00:20:57,063
They're out there
looking for me right now.

210
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:59,961
They got ghetto birds and black ops.

211
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:01,864
I need to get high.

212
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:04,171
I need to get good and high.

213
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:12,054
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

214
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,821
It's killer.

215
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:17,976
Yeah, seriously.

216
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:24,821
So, I was thinking last night.

217
00:21:25,665 --> 00:21:27,277
I came up with this great idea.

218
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,441
<i>México.</i>

219
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:32,324
Mexico?

220
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:36,119
We'll disappear way
out in the jungle.

221
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,373
We'll set you up in a superlab.

222
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:41,076
We'll do nothing but cook 24-7.

223
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:45,171
And nofederales are going to mess
with us, because I got my people there.

224
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:46,296
Connections.

225
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:49,310
We're going to make

226
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:51,551
<i>beaucoup</i> bucks, Heisenberg.

227
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:56,640
I have a wife and family.

228
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,979
So what?
You'll get another one.

229
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:04,084
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I can't just...

230
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,855
uproot my life like that.

231
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,902
Yeah, man.
I mean, me, neither.

232
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,615
Who's talking to you?

233
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:19,913
You need me, man,

234
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:23,250
'cause I cooked
that scante in your hands.

235
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:29,479
I'll tell you something, yo.

236
00:22:29,604 --> 00:22:31,974
You never tried nothing like it.

237
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,902
Stink or no stink,

238
00:22:35,241 --> 00:22:36,275
one bump,

239
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,307
you'll be flying high for days.

240
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,415
It's a new product him
and I been working up.

241
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:47,127
Careful when you hit it.

242
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:50,444
It kicks like a 12-gauge
when it comes on.

243
00:22:53,797 --> 00:22:55,815
It's got a secret ingredient.

244
00:22:58,326 --> 00:22:59,744
What secret ingredient?

245
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:02,399
Chili powder.

246
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:11,256
I hate chili powder.

247
00:23:15,432 --> 00:23:18,221
This blue magic, this is money.

248
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:22,864
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

249
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:30,099
We're going to rewrite
history with this.

250
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,314
All right!

251
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:37,949
Time to clean the <i>menudo</i> out
from between your ears!

252
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,203
No, I need him, Tuco.

253
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:44,206
I need him very, very badly.

254
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:47,667
He's my partner.

255
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:51,046
And if he doesn't go,

256
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,551
I don't go.

257
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,755
I'll tell you this,
my cousins are driving up here

258
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,172
right now to smuggle us back down,
and they're going to be here by sunset,

259
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:05,200
and you're going to be on that truck,
or you're going to be dead!

260
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:08,159
And you...

261
00:24:09,757 --> 00:24:12,800
You better hope
they got room in the trunk.

262
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,617
Where are you going?

263
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,338
Louis is taking me
to the train station.

264
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:33,133
We'll put these up.

265
00:24:33,258 --> 00:24:34,916
No, no, honey.
No, I'll do it.

266
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,340
He wants to help, let him help.

267
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:40,784
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

268
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:45,013
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

269
00:24:45,907 --> 00:24:48,905
For Christ sake,
you got a bun in the oven.

270
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,387
I got my cell if you need me.

271
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:56,483
Bye, sweetie.
I'll see you later.

272
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,038
All right. Bye.

273
00:25:01,305 --> 00:25:02,404
Actually,

274
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:06,155
I think the very fact they haven't
found him yet...

275
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,605
bodes well.

276
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:10,955
Well, I mean, if he...

277
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:12,892
You know.

278
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,212
Somebody would've smelled
something by now.

279
00:25:18,164 --> 00:25:22,133
There's got to be something, some
detail that we haven't picked up on.

280
00:25:23,186 --> 00:25:24,969
What about the second cell phone?

281
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,815
Aw, Jesus.

282
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:30,433
We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

283
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,895
Okay. What are you talking about?

284
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:41,868
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared,

285
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:44,739
there's no record of it
with the phone company.

286
00:25:45,448 --> 00:25:47,659
No incoming,
no dropped calls, nothing.

287
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:50,152
But his phone rang.
I heard it.

288
00:25:50,277 --> 00:25:53,372
Well, all right.
Well, then, if that's the case,

289
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:56,119
he must have a second phone.

290
00:25:58,554 --> 00:26:01,483
Why? What sense
would there be in that?

291
00:26:01,608 --> 00:26:05,022
All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

292
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:10,246
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
"secret cell phone" and then drop it.

293
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:11,960
What does it mean?

294
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,823
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

295
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:18,650
It means Walt has a secret.

296
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:22,380
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

297
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,294
"Everyone."

298
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,299
Skyler, come on.

299
00:26:28,424 --> 00:26:31,911
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

300
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:37,873
Then, let's assume
there'a second cell phone.

301
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:40,295
So, what? Is he having an affair?

302
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,839
Walt? Please.

303
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:48,553
What about the marijuana?

304
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,528
He's not on pot anymore.

305
00:26:53,122 --> 00:26:54,524
Says who? Him?

306
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,099
Chemotherapy and marijuana
go together

307
00:26:58,224 --> 00:27:00,908
like apple pie and Chevrolet.

308
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:02,852
Maybe...

309
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:05,818
he's addicted to the pot,

310
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,393
and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

311
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:12,004
You don't get hooked
on pot like that.

312
00:27:12,129 --> 00:27:15,246
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

313
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:20,168
You have to question
this drug dealer person.

314
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,069
He may know something.

315
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:30,734
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

316
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:33,727
Then grasp.

317
00:27:44,406 --> 00:27:45,704
Excuse me. Ma'am?

318
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:49,989
Hi. I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

319
00:27:50,993 --> 00:27:52,575
No. I'm afraid not.

320
00:27:52,822 --> 00:27:55,520
- Why?
- I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

321
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,964
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

322
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:03,727
He taught your son
chemistry in high school.

323
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:07,069
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

324
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:09,050
That was a long time ago.

325
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:10,268
Yes, ma'am.

326
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:13,805
It's my understanding that he and Jesse,
they've stayed in touch.

327
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:15,556
Really?

328
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:22,644
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

329
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,993
He really tried to motivate him.

330
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:27,888
He was one of the few
teachers who cared.

331
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,269
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

332
00:28:30,394 --> 00:28:32,482
I'm so sorry to hear
about his illness.

333
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:34,719
Please pass along our best wishes.

334
00:28:34,844 --> 00:28:37,547
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

335
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:38,955
He's missing, actually.

336
00:28:39,794 --> 00:28:41,374
Just kind of walked off or...

337
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,995
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around

338
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,630
trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

339
00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:49,478
That's terrible.

340
00:28:49,837 --> 00:28:51,864
Anything we can do to help?

341
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:55,358
Well, if you could put me
in touch with your son.

342
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,564
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

343
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:01,195
Jesse's not answering either
phone number I have for him,

344
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,319
and no one seems
to be home at his house.

345
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:06,941
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

346
00:29:08,432 --> 00:29:10,879
I don't necessarily. I just...

347
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:14,818
- Are you with the police?
- No, ma'am. Not at all.

348
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:19,454
I'm with the
Drug Enforcement Administration.

349
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:23,750
Oh, my God.
Is my son in trouble?

350
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:26,794
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

351
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,012
Do I need to get a lawyer?

352
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:31,993
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this,

353
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:34,260
coming here and asking
questions about my son...

354
00:29:34,385 --> 00:29:36,858
Mrs. Pinkman, I swear to you,
I'm not here on official capacity.

355
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:41,244
I do not care what your son
may or may not have done wrong.

356
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:43,960
I just want to find
my brother-in-law.

357
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:45,931
His wife is worried sick,

358
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:48,359
and she's got a baby on the way.

359
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:52,378
I'm sorry.
I would like to help you,

360
00:29:52,503 --> 00:29:55,042
but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

361
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,811
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

362
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:02,073
Well, thanks for your time.

363
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:09,582
If you could tell me one more thing.

364
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,928
Is Jesse still driving the, uh,

365
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:14,950
'89 Chevy Monte Carlo,
as far as you know?

366
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:17,317
If he had spent half as much time

367
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,555
and money on his education

368
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,258
as he has on that
ridiculous bouncing car...

369
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:27,423
Lowrider, huh?

370
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,166
Nah, nothing yet. Listen,
do me a solid and check out a...

371
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,521
'89 Chevy Monte Carlo

372
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:38,901
registered to a one Jesse Pinkman.

373
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,226
Specifically? I want to know
if the car's got LoJack.

374
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:47,154
It's one of those jackoff lowriders.
It's got a good shot that there is.

375
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,920
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

376
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,397
Chili powder.

377
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:22,988
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

378
00:31:23,302 --> 00:31:24,423
Whatever, man.

379
00:31:24,836 --> 00:31:26,914
At least I tried something.

380
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:28,812
It almost worked, too.

381
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:31,282
How's about you leaving my gun?

382
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:35,104
First you boost it, then
you leave it in your house.

383
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,285
My gun.

384
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:40,307
How was I supposed to know

385
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,373
you were chauffeuring Tuco
to my doorstep?

386
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:46,368
Well, at least he wants you alive.

387
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,387
Hey, I don't get it.

388
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:25,325
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

389
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:26,959
I don't know.

390
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:29,438
I don't know.

391
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:33,152
Does it really matter?

392
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:37,199
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant,

393
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,686
who does he automatically blame?

394
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:40,874
Us.

395
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:45,952
We need a plan.

396
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:49,414
Think, think.

397
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,492
Let's just bum-rush him, man.

398
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:54,079
You know, you crack him
over the head with something,

399
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:55,964
and I'll go for his gun.

400
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:03,553
"Crack him over the head
with something"?

401
00:33:07,066 --> 00:33:09,573
And you got the C-bomb, man.

402
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,921
You're as good
as checked out already.

403
00:33:12,046 --> 00:33:14,349
You should be, like,
all sacrificial,

404
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:16,485
jumping on a grenade, yo.

405
00:33:19,737 --> 00:33:22,475
Oh, so my life
is not the priority here,

406
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,198
because I'm going
to be dead soon anyway.

407
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:26,950
That's your point?

408
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:59,154
We got to get him to take this.

409
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,174
He don't much like
the taste of chili P.

410
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,071
That much has been established.

411
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,199
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump...

412
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:13,636
Eat.

413
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,174
We've got a long ride ahead of us.

414
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:35,269
Go and sit.

415
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:37,229
You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

416
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:40,596
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

417
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:20,780
Take it easy, <i>tio</i>.

418
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,635
I will feed you. I eat first.

419
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,361
That's the deal.

420
00:35:33,554 --> 00:35:34,554
What?

421
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:44,955
I get it, I get it, I get it.

422
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:48,258
You greedy old bastard.

423
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,433
I tell you, Heisenberg...

424
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:54,599
Old people.

425
00:35:56,227 --> 00:35:57,697
You feed them, huh?

426
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,689
You put them in a really
nice crib in the country,

427
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,733
and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

428
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:06,841
You better eat every bite of that.

429
00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:32,519
What did you do that for?

430
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:34,514
God!

431
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:19,757
Look. Lookit.

432
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:21,645
There's nothing left.

433
00:37:48,203 --> 00:37:49,203
What?

434
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:51,192
What do you want?

435
00:37:59,717 --> 00:38:02,469
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

436
00:38:03,128 --> 00:38:04,177
Don't go there.

437
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:19,494
Are you mad-dogging them, <i>tio</i>?

438
00:38:21,612 --> 00:38:23,689
What, you don't like them?

439
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:29,418
One ding. That means "yes."

440
00:38:29,794 --> 00:38:31,298
<i>Tio</i> don't like you.

441
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:38,131
Why don't you like them, <i>tio</i>?

442
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:43,518
You don't trust them?

443
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:52,728
Why don't you trust them, <i>tio</i>?

444
00:38:52,853 --> 00:38:55,477
Tuco, come on.
I mean, he's...

445
00:38:56,798 --> 00:38:59,868
There's clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

446
00:39:13,078 --> 00:39:14,966
Did they do something to you, <i>tio</i>?

447
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:21,041
Something that you don't like?

448
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,476
What did they do to you?

449
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,791
What did you do to my <i>tio</i>?

450
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:32,942
Nothing.

451
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,445
Bullshit! My <i>tio</i> does not lie!

452
00:39:36,184 --> 00:39:38,534
I don't know. I swear.
I don't know.

453
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,284
Maybe, I did change

454
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:43,389
the channel on his TV, but...

455
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:47,810
That's it. While you were cooking,
he was watching one of those...

456
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,225
those "telenovels"
with all those ripe honeys on it?

457
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:54,262
He was really into it. I told you
not to change the channel, man!

458
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:57,338
Dude needs his eye candy. That's it.

459
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:05,558
Is that it, <i>tio</i>?

460
00:40:07,193 --> 00:40:08,395
Is that it, <i>tio</i>?

461
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,269
Did they change your <i>mamitas</i>?

462
00:40:21,675 --> 00:40:23,832
What are you telling me, <i>tio</i>?

463
00:40:26,393 --> 00:40:27,706
Are they punking me?

464
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:46,994
No, man.

465
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:50,228
Come here!

466
00:41:08,954 --> 00:41:09,999
Shut up!

467
00:41:23,945 --> 00:41:24,971
Please, no!

468
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:28,558
Please, no! No, God!
I don't want to die!

469
00:41:29,335 --> 00:41:31,311
Tell me what you did, Walter!

470
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:32,849
Jesus!

471
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:34,814
I don't want to die!

472
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:38,693
Tell me what you did!

473
00:41:44,714 --> 00:41:46,553
We tried to poison you.

474
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:50,497
We tried to poison you,

475
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:54,527
because you're an insane,

476
00:41:54,652 --> 00:41:56,419
degenerate piece of filth,

477
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,546
and you deserve to die.

478
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:43,299
Who's the bitch now?

479
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,587
Let him bleed.

480
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:25,795
The keys!

481
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:30,999
Oh, my God.

482
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,434
The cousins?

483
00:44:31,757 --> 00:44:33,649
What the hell's going on?

484
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:46,000
Jesse Pinkman.

485
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:49,311
You're a hard man to find.

486
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:58,798
Aw, shit.

487
00:45:11,528 --> 00:45:12,528
Easy.

488
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:16,992
Oh, my God.

489
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:31,133
Oh, my God.

490
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:37,694
- Hank.
- Who?

491
00:46:37,942 --> 00:46:39,503
- Hank.
- What?

492
00:46:40,366 --> 00:46:41,885
- Oh, my God.
- What?

493
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,808
- Oh, my God.
- Stay. What are you doing?
