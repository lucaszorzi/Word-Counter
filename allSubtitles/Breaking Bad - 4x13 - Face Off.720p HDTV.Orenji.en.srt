<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:03,619 --> 00:00:07,569
All dead.
As is your grandson.

3
00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:11,872
I think Brock may have been poisoned
with something called ricin.

4
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:15,381
Shut up!
Why did you poison him?

5
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:19,168
Who do you know? Gus allowed
children to be murdered. Gus!

6
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:21,235
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Then let me help.

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,963
Don't go! Don't go!
No! No!

8
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:36,278
What did you say to Gus?

9
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:38,347
Because he's on to us.
Yeah.

10
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,016
I didn't say jack.
What do you mean he's on to us?

11
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,019
He's walking to his car.
Then suddenly he isn't.

12
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:45,255
What, does he have
some kind of sixth sense?

13
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,958
Jesus, what did you say to him?

14
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:50,695
Could I ask my own question
right now, at this point?

15
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,232
Did you just bring a bomb
into a hospital?

16
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:56,703
What? Was I supposed
to leave it on his car?

17
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:58,738
What, you're supposed
to bring it into a hospital?

18
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:01,641
Oh, my God.

19
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:06,546
Look. Where can we find Gus?
Name a place.

20
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,514
Name me one place
where I could surprise him,

21
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:09,882
where he won't see me coming.

22
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:15,154
Because his house, the laundry,

23
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:16,989
the restaurant,
the factory farm,

24
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:18,457
they're all wired with cameras.

25
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:20,893
One place.

26
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,328
Think.

27
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:23,563
Jesse, think.

28
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:25,799
Where is it?
Where?

29
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,468
Because if you can't tell me,

30
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:30,704
we are dead.

31
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:42,484
Jesse.

32
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:44,286
I don't-- I don't know.

33
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,588
Well, maybe--

34
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:49,157
Excuse me.
Jesse Pinkman?

35
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:50,358
Uh, yeah.

36
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:52,327
Hi.
Detective Kalanchoe.

37
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,963
This is Detective Munn,
Albuquerque Police.

38
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:57,532
We were wondering if we could
have a few minutes of your time,

39
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,000
maybe go someplace and talk.

40
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:00,301
About what?

41
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:01,870
Sorry, sir,
I didn't catch your name.

42
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:03,038
About what?

43
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:04,941
It concerns Brock Cantillo

44
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:07,543
and a statement
you made to his mother.

45
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:09,212
How about you come with us?

46
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,581
We just want to clear
a few things up. No big deal.

48
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:50,890
Am I under arrest?

49
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:53,360
No, you're not under arrest.

50
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:54,661
We're just talking.

51
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:56,463
So if I get tired of talking,

52
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:57,731
want to get up and leave--

53
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,166
We'd prefer you didn't.

54
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:02,436
You'd prefer, so--

55
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,970
Jesse, why did you
tell Brock's mom

56
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:07,040
that the boy had been poisoned?

57
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:12,111
Look, I think this has been,
you know,

58
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:13,746
uh, what do you call it?

59
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,016
Overblown, because
all I basically said was

60
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,087
"Have the doctors thought
maybe Brock got poisoned?"

61
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,256
You know, in a cover-all-bases
kind of sense.

62
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,959
Yeah. No, I'm sure
they appreciated that,

63
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:27,594
you helping them out like that,

64
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,663
especially with how specific
you were and all.

65
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:31,699
Ricin. Wow.

66
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,135
Yeah, ricin--
that's definitely a big one.

67
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:35,437
You don't see that every day,

68
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:36,938
so when doctors,
they hear that,

69
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:38,974
they take it very seriously,

70
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:40,944
as do we,

71
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:42,712
as does the FBI.

72
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,180
Okay.

73
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:46,817
And nice, you trying to
help out like that and all,

74
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:48,952
you know,
professional courtesy,

75
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:51,121
sharing your expertise.

76
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:54,258
I ain't go no expertise.

77
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,826
All right?
I just, you know--

78
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:58,228
You just happen to guess
this one rare poison

79
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,998
might be the thing that put this
little boy in the hospital.

80
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,434
And congratulations,
because his doctors,

81
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:06,070
they're beginning to think
that you might just be right.

82
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:07,771
So why ricin?

83
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,040
Jesse, how did you come up
with that?

84
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:11,842
Man, I think I've--

85
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:14,612
I don't know. I must've saw it
on <i>House</i> or something.

86
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:15,680
Huh.

87
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:16,748
Yeah, you know, like <i>House</i>

88
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:19,083
or the Discovery Channel.

89
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,986
Sometimes your brain just
makes these connections.

90
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,988
- Does it?
- Mine does.

91
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,923
That's interesting.

92
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:28,626
Look, I've got to get back.

93
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,327
But we're still talking.

94
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,732
So I'm not under arrest,
but I can't leave.

95
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:42,239
So, then, I guess I should
call my lawyer. Right?

96
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:45,475
We're just having
a simple conversation, Jess.

97
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,378
Why can't we keep talking,
keep it light?

98
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,814
Man, you know how it is
when the lawyers get to it.

99
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,483
Suddenly everything's
a big pissing match,

100
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:54,718
like, every time.

101
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:56,020
Adversarial.

102
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:58,455
Adversarial. Then we gotta
book you, blah, blah. Right?

103
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:00,958
I mean, you know.
You've been around the block, Jesse.

104
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,694
You're no boy scout.

105
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,598
Saul Goodman.

106
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,768
That's my guy.

107
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,604
So do I gotta call him,
or do you?

108
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,111
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

109
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,612
I need Saul.
I need him right now.

110
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,081
So you break into the place.
You just break in! Jesus!

111
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,449
You're here, by the way.

112
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,585
If you'd had bothered answering
the phone or the door,

113
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,854
maybe I wouldn't have--
Forget it.

114
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:02,855
Is he here?

115
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,089
Is that a serious question?

116
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,791
Why would he be here?

117
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,226
You know where he is,
don't you?

118
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,360
I need a number.

119
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,897
Look. Let me explain
something to you.

120
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,865
- My partner and I--
- Are in danger?

121
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,466
Whoop-dee-freaking-doo.

122
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,767
Why do you think he's not here?

123
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,703
And how's that news, exactly,

124
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,838
the two of you being in danger,

125
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,673
after doing something idiotic?

126
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:25,509
And what gives you the right
to break down my door?

127
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:28,312
Look, I just need a number.
Okay? That's all.

128
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,448
You are such a pain in my ass.

129
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:32,049
You know that?

130
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,351
You're the reason
I've got to go on unemployment

131
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,152
for God knows how long.

132
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,320
I was at least looking forward

133
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,955
to getting out of here
in the next half hour,

134
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,990
but no!

135
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,791
Now I've got to wait
around all day

136
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:42,859
for a plate glass guy
to come and fix this door,

137
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:43,994
and who pays for this?

138
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:46,429
Okay, you know what?

139
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:48,231
Here, look.
I'm giving you everything,

140
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:49,699
all of it, okay?

141
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,533
There's one, two, three--

142
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:55,103
Look, there's got to be
at least $1,700 there, okay?

143
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:56,638
That will more than cover
the cost of the door.

144
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,473
Now, I apologize profusely.

145
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:00,442
Please, the phone number.

146
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,981
Door like this is going to
cost way more than 1,700.

147
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:08,384
What? For a plate of glass?
No.

148
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:10,787
Oh, yeah, I bet it does.

149
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:12,689
I bet you
it winds up costing...

150
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:16,326
20,000.

151
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:19,930
Are you insane?

152
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:22,165
Who the hell is going
to charge $20,000

153
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,200
for a plate glass door?

154
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:26,735
There's no
reputable vendor w--

155
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:35,276
Now I'm thinking 25.

156
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:44,684
I'll be right back.

157
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:54,122
Yes, Albuquerque, New Mexico.

158
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:57,592
The number of Rebecca Simmons,

159
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:00,462
306 Negra Arroyo Lane.

160
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:03,065
Would you connect it
for me, please?

161
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:04,533
Thank you.

162
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:11,808
Becky, hi, it's Walter White.

163
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,710
Listen, I wa--

164
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,212
I'm-I'm-- I'm fine.

165
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:16,380
I'm fine. How are you?

166
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,817
Oh, good, good.

167
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:22,219
Yes, cats are--

168
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,322
Listen, Skyler and I
are out of town.

169
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:26,857
We're on our way up
to Santa Fe,

170
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:28,925
and Junior just told us

171
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,595
that he thinks he may
have left the burner on,

172
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,863
on the stove.

173
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:36,499
Yes, God forbid there's a fire.

174
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,969
Well, that's--
that's why I'm calling.

175
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:41,771
I just wanted to ask,

176
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:43,807
and I'm sorry to do this,

177
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:45,575
but do you still have the key?

178
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:46,743
You do?

179
00:10:46,777 --> 00:10:48,678
Good. And would you be
willing to--

180
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,015
Oh, you are a life saver.

181
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,684
Thank you so much.

182
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:57,722
Yes. Okay. Okay,
I'll await your call.

183
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,558
Thank you so much.
Bye-bye.

184
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:17,110
There you go.

185
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,099
Becky?

186
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:49,138
Oh. Oh, that's good.

187
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:50,939
That's a relief.

188
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:53,942
I owe you one, big time.

189
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:03,845
So how's he doing?

190
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:07,915
Yo, you could at least say,

191
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:10,717
instead of being
a couple of dicks about it.

192
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:14,921
Jesse, if you cared at all
about that little boy,

193
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,290
prove it to me.

194
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,125
Tell us what you know.

195
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,326
I told you what I know.

196
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,527
Tell us again.

197
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,999
What are you, like--
like broken records?

198
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,501
I was trying to be helpful.

199
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:31,772
End of story.

200
00:14:31,806 --> 00:14:33,741
Guess we'll have to wait and
see what the tox screen says.

201
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:40,148
Oh, look at this.
Isn't this cozy?

202
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:41,383
What did you tell them?

203
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,284
I told them they were
a couple of dicks.

204
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,286
He's a wordsmith.

205
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:46,921
Well, Detectives,

206
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:47,922
it's been a pleasure.

207
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:48,922
Now, up you go.

208
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:50,257
Make like you've got manners.

209
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,226
Make like you respect
the rule of law.

210
00:14:53,261 --> 00:14:55,628
<i>Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen,</i>

211
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,530
<i>hasta luego,</i> get the hell out.

212
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,131
Buh-bye.

213
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,099
That's it. Pick it up.
Follow your partner.

214
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,368
And one, two...

215
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:06,103
Thank you.

216
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,306
Christ. You two.

217
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,408
All I can say is
if I ever get anal polyps,

218
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,109
I'll know what to name them.

219
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,412
You gonna get me out of here?

220
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,249
Ah. Hm. No.

221
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,384
Not even if I could.

222
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,921
You know, the FBI's going to
show up on this ricin thing,

223
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,289
and then you're in it
for the duration.

224
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,261
You know,
you're a lot safer in here.

225
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,930
They just tried to get
your partner in his own home.

226
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,199
Jesus.

227
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,600
Is he okay?

228
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:39,437
Well, he's okay
like a fruit fly's okay.

229
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,072
We're all on the clock here,

230
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,507
and thanks for that,
by the way.

231
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,810
You two want to stick
your wangs in a hornet's nest,

232
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,345
it's a free country,

233
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,082
but how come I always gotta
get sloppy seconds, huh?

234
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,584
Have you got anything for me?

235
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,487
I mean, tell me I didn't
poke my head up for nothing.

236
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,525
Yeah.

237
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,728
I've been thinking.

238
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:01,795
And?

239
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:05,566
Casa Tranquila.

240
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,067
What's Casa Tranquila?

241
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:09,603
It's an old folks' home
off Paseo Del Norte.

242
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:11,605
Our boy tells me
Fring took him there

243
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,106
to visit one of the patients,

244
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,042
someone Pinkman says
you'll definitely remember--

245
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,443
Tio Salamanca.

246
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,080
Old guy in a wheelchair.

247
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,785
Um, doesn't talk,

248
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,621
rings a bell.

249
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:29,656
I don't mean
"Does that ring a bell?"

250
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,359
I mean, the guy actually
has to ring a bell.

251
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:33,761
I-- Yes, I know.
I remember.

252
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:38,266
So what, once every blue moon,

253
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:42,305
Gus goes and visits
an old cartel associate.

254
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:45,241
That-- That doesn't help me.

255
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:46,743
I can't very well hide out

256
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:48,210
in a nursing home
for six months,

257
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:50,112
hoping, on the off chance,

258
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:52,815
that he comes back.

259
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,318
It's not even like
they're friends.

260
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:58,587
Pinkman said it was like
he was torturing the old guy.

261
00:16:58,622 --> 00:16:59,955
What does that mean?

262
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:03,959
He told him the last
of his family was dead.

263
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:05,728
He seemed to enjoy telling him.

264
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,463
Afterward, Pinkman
asked him about it.

265
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:09,598
All Gus would say
was that this Tio character

266
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:12,201
once murdered
someone close to him.

267
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:16,138
Wait. Tio murdered
someone close to Gus?

268
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:19,442
I know it sound
not particularly fruitful,

269
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:23,112
but, sorry, that's all I got.

270
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:26,982
They're enemies,

271
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:28,217
not friends.

272
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,421
Your next
number in this coverall game,

273
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,456
where you cover
the whole shmoley,

274
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:37,026
is B number 3

275
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,428
like <i>Goldilocks</i>
<i>and the Three Bears.</i>

276
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:43,098
That's number 3
in your B column,

277
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:47,402
followed by O-74.

278
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:51,873
That's O-74 on the other
side of your card.

279
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:59,515
Now we have that lucky number--
B number 7.

280
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:03,953
Is it lucky for you?
B-7.

281
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:06,823
In the "I" row, 2-1.

282
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,795
I know you despise me,

283
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,600
and I know how badly
you want to see me dead,

284
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:17,335
but I'm willing to bet

285
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,872
that I know a man
whom you hate even more.

286
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:21,807
Those Ns just keep coming.

287
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:23,642
They're all sticking together.

288
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:27,513
I am offering you
an opportunity

289
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:28,614
for revenge.

290
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:30,683
Column 4-8,

291
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,418
the continental United States,

292
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:34,920
excluding Alaska and Hawaii.

293
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,172
Okay, I'm here.

294
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:58,141
How you doing this morning,
Mr. Salamanca?

295
00:18:58,176 --> 00:18:59,776
You need something?

296
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,278
You need to go poopie?
Huh?

297
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:04,547
Did you go poopie already?
No?

298
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:06,650
What do you need?

299
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:08,752
Want me to get
the board for you?

300
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:10,220
Okay.

301
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:13,023
All right.

302
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,961
Okay, here we go.

303
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:23,100

00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,401

314
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:43,586
Next letter-- E.

315
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,820

A-E-I-O-U...

330
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:17,622
I don't think we're finished,
Mr. Salamanca.

331
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:22,960
A-E-I-O-U...

332
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:24,762
Finish the word,
Mr. Salamanca.

333
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:28,165
Is it "dear"?

334
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:32,103
Is it "deal"?

335
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,641
Honey, "dea" ain't a word.

336
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:39,009
Help me out here.

337
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,269
Hey, son, what's up?

338
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:10,939
When exactly
are you getting here?

339
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:13,676
<i>Uh, just as soon as I can.</i>

340
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,611
Look, this is
a serious situation,

341
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:17,446
and it's like you're not
taking it seriously.

342
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:18,815
Give me the phone.
Let me talk to him.

343
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,450
<i>No, son, I am
taking it</i> <i>very seriously.</i>

344
00:21:20,484 --> 00:21:22,319
Just-- Just give it to me,
Walt.

345
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,056
<i>I'm very concerned</i> <i>about your
Uncle Hank</i> <i>and his safety,</i>

346
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,193
but whomever is making
these threats against him,

347
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:32,396
I can assure you there's
no interest in me.

348
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:34,832
I'm not on--
on anyone's radar,

349
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:36,467
<i>- and besides your mother and I.</i>
- Give it to me.

350
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:37,701
Walter?

351
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:39,169
Did you hear what he said?

352
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:40,504
Get over here.

353
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,039
<i>No more excuses.</i>

354
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:44,941
Marie, I will be there
just as soon as I can.

355
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:46,243
- I promise.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

356
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,079
You want to weigh in here?

357
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:50,914
Maybe you could talk
some sense into him.

358
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:54,084
Marie, he'll get here
when he gets here, so just...

359
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:59,589
Well, I hope you sell
plenty of air fresheners.

360
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:02,258
<i>I hope you just have</i>
<i>a banner day over there.</i>

361
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,493
<i>Okay, Walt?</i>

362
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:04,894
<i>Don't worry</i> <i>about a thing here.</i>

363
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:07,063
Goodbye.

364
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:08,798
And thank you

365
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:11,367
for all of your help.

366
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:12,668
Huh?

367
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,544
Anything?

368
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:41,463
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi, Steve.

369
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:42,564
How's everybody holding up?

370
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:44,499
Hey, Gomie,
just the man I want to see.

371
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:45,667
Come here, look at this.

372
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:49,070
Jesus, enough with the laundry.

373
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:50,772
No, no, no, hear me out.

374
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:52,907
This panel,
if I'm reading it correctly,

375
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:55,143
is a 7,200-amp service.

376
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:56,277
This place has two of them.

377
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:57,411
All right?

378
00:22:57,446 --> 00:22:59,480
That's a whole lot of juice,
brother.

379
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:02,383
Laundry this size typically
has maybe half that, okay?

380
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:04,118
So what's with the extra panel?

381
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:05,619
What are you,
Thomas Edison now?

382
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:07,355
No, I asked
a bunch of electricians.

383
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:08,689
They have their own chat rooms,

384
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:11,125
you know, like where all
they talk about was wiring?

385
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,329
Freakin' Internet-- find
anything on it these days.

386
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:15,663
What do you say?

387
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,666
Pop over,
have another look-see?

388
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,037
Listen.

389
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:25,141
I think we possibly have
a lead on something.

390
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:26,375
Yeah?

391
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,177
I have this guy
down at the office.

392
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:30,380
He says he has
some kind of information.

393
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:33,015
The thing is,
he'll only give it to you,

394
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,818
in person.

395
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:42,058
Okay.

396
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,560
Remember Hector Salamanca?

397
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:44,828
Sh-- Yeah.

398
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,863
What, you mean the old
cripple guy with the bell?

399
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:48,599
Rather crap on our floor
than talk to us?

400
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:50,200
No, I don't remember him
at all. Why?

401
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:52,803
Well, he's the guy.

402
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:54,004
His nurse calls us,

403
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:56,774
says he wants to powwow.

404
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,409
So we have this guy
at the office

405
00:23:58,444 --> 00:23:59,844
for three hours,

406
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:02,481
and he still just wants
to talk to you.

407
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:06,486
Do not even think
about going down there.

408
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,654
Marie.

409
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:08,921
This is clearly a ploy

410
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:10,223
or a trick or something

411
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:12,792
designed to get Hank
out into the open.

412
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,893
That's all this is.

413
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:15,161
That's what we thought.

414
00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:16,529
Well.

415
00:24:16,564 --> 00:24:19,065
It's been years since
this guy's been a player.

416
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,466
His nephew's gone.

417
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,768
Doesn't have anybody.

418
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:24,070
The nurse checks out--
doesn't know nothing.

419
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:27,307
Guess I just don't see
an angle in it,

420
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,275
if there even is one.

421
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:32,578
Of course, if you did want
to talk to this guy,

422
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,313
there's not safer place
than the office.

423
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:37,782
I don't think this sounds
like a good idea.

424
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:39,117
Yeah, I agree, Uncle Hank.

425
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:41,486
It is a ridiculous idea,

426
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,888
and there is no way
you are going to do it,

427
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:45,223
end of story.

428
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:49,594
Hank, thanks for coming down.

429
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:52,297
No problem at all.
Good to see you, sir.

430
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,379
So Mr. Salamanca.

431
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:06,747
You had something
you want to tell me?

432
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,425
A-E-I-O--

433
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:22,162
Row O.

434
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,633
First letter-- S.

435
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:31,171
A-E-I-O-U--

436
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,873
Second letter-- U.

437
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:35,609
A--

438
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:37,611
B-C--

439
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:42,015
A-E-I--

440
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:44,384
J-K--

441
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:48,622
A-E-I--

442
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:53,027
J-K-L-M--

443
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:59,700
A-E-I-O-U--

444
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:01,135
Row U.

445
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:04,472
V-W-X-Y--

446
00:26:04,506 --> 00:26:06,574
All right, that's enough.

447
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:11,146
Thank you.

448
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,582
Yeah, thanks.
I can spell.

449
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:19,155
Well, you got that
out of your system now?

450
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,091
Shall we try this
one more time?

451
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:31,534
F--

452
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:36,038
A-E-I-O-U--

453
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:41,843
A--

454
00:26:41,877 --> 00:26:42,944
B-C--

455
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:46,914
Yeah, we-- we got it.

456
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:49,784
I am-- I am--
I am just so, so sorry.

457
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:01,062
Well, at least this time
he didn't shit himself.

458
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,833
Guess that's progress.

459
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,430
<i>Yes.</i>

460
00:27:34,465 --> 00:27:36,299
We may have a problem.

461
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,800
I've got eyes on the DEA.

462
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:40,519
<i>They just had</i>
<i>a visitor--</i>

463
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:44,019
<i>Hector Salamanca.</i>

464
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:55,880
I don't even know
what to say to you right now.

465
00:27:55,914 --> 00:27:57,281
You just sit here,

466
00:27:57,316 --> 00:27:58,449
and you think about how far

467
00:27:58,483 --> 00:28:00,552
that kind of behavior
is going to get you.

468
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:02,286
Not far, let me tell you.

469
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:17,736
Any second thoughts?

470
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:22,840
Then let's get to work.

471
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:55,765
Hello!

472
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:59,735
Shh.

473
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:35,704
Mr. Pinkman...

474
00:31:36,907 --> 00:31:38,140
you're free to go.

475
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:40,242
Why?

476
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:41,543
What happened?

477
00:31:41,578 --> 00:31:43,078
Tox screen came back.

478
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:45,580
No ricin poisoning.

479
00:31:47,516 --> 00:31:49,151
Surprised, huh?

480
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:53,355
No, why should I be?

481
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:55,124
Your jacket.

482
00:31:59,162 --> 00:32:00,629
Till we meet again.

483
00:32:07,703 --> 00:32:08,870
Hey, yo!

484
00:32:08,904 --> 00:32:11,638
Yo! Right here.

485
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,279
Hey, Andrea,
I'm just checking on Brock.

486
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:24,317
Uh, hey, it sounds like--

487
00:32:24,352 --> 00:32:27,821
I mean, listen, just call me
if you can, all right?

488
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:28,989
I'm headed back over.

489
00:32:30,224 --> 00:32:31,424
Hey, excuse me.

490
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,544
Yes.

491
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:52,380
<i>We just picked up Pinkman.</i>

492
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:53,815
<i>No witnesses.</i>

493
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:57,819
What about Hector?

494
00:32:57,853 --> 00:33:00,888
I've checked inside and out.

495
00:33:00,922 --> 00:33:03,023
No wires, no camera,

496
00:33:03,057 --> 00:33:04,925
no surveillance.

497
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:07,127
A police cruiser rolled
through about an hour ago.

498
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,394
Seemed routine.

499
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:10,763
<i>It's just him,</i>
<i>alone in his room.</i>

500
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,468
All right.

501
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:19,904
I'm on my way.

502
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:22,673
Maybe it's better if--

503
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:24,808
if I do this myself.

504
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:27,244
I do this.

505
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,652
It's all clear.

506
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:19,325
Wait here.

507
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:32,167
What kind of man
talks to the DEA?

508
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,204
No man.

509
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,806
No man at all.

510
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:22,255
A crippled little <i>rata.</i>

511
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,624
What a reputation
to leave behind.

512
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:40,773
Is that how you want
to be remembered?

513
00:37:46,713 --> 00:37:48,447
Last chance to look
at me, Hector.

514
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,278
Aah!

515
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:30,191
Oh, my God.

516
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,892
Oh, Jesus.

517
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:33,694
Oh, Jesus.

518
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:49,977
<i>The same vote for sure.</i>

519
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:51,546
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>
<i>It's that time again,</i>

520
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,681
<i>where we tell you</i> <i>about your
own</i> <i>personal slice of hell</i>

521
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:55,550
<i>known as the Albuquerque</i>
<i>afternoon commute.</i>

522
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,085
<i>How bad are things</i>
<i>looking out there?</i>

523
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,720
<i>I'll tell you what.
</i> <i>Right now southbound 25</i>

524
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,155
<i>has got an accident there</i>
<i>at Jefferson</i>

525
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:01,390
<i>on the right shoulder,</i>

526
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:02,791
<i>so make sure you stay</i>
<i>to the left</i>

527
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:04,360
<i>as you move</i> <i>through that area,</i>

528
00:39:04,394 --> 00:39:06,429
<i>and things have slowed</i>
<i>to a crawl at the Big I,</i>

529
00:39:06,463 --> 00:39:07,696
<i>no surprises there, either.</i>

530
00:39:07,731 --> 00:39:08,931
<i>All right, hang on.</i>

531
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:10,099
<i>I hate</i> <i>to interrupt you here,</i>

532
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,567
<i>but I do have some breaking</i>
<i>news here,</i>

533
00:39:11,601 --> 00:39:13,235
<i>now coming</i> <i>out of the North
Valley,</i> <i>apparently.</i>

534
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,804
<i>An explosion has been</i>
<i>reported at a nursing home,</i>

535
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,573
<i>the Casa Tranquila</i>
<i>Nursing Home.</i>

536
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,175
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
<i>- You heard of that place.</i>

537
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:22,377
<i>We've got very few details</i>
<i>on it so far,</i> <i>unfortunately.</i>

538
00:39:22,412 --> 00:39:23,712
<i>The initial report is,</i> <i>though,</i>

539
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:25,948
<i>that as many as three people</i>
<i>may have been killed.</i>

540
00:39:25,982 --> 00:39:27,282
<i>Oh, no.</i>

541
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:28,717
<i>Now, the news is disturbing.</i>

542
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:30,085
<i>We're going to get you</i>
<i>more information on this</i>

543
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,853
<i>just as soon as it comes in.</i>

544
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:33,955
<i>Situation over there,</i>
<i>I imagine, is pretty hectic.</i>

545
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:35,323
<i>What's traffic looking like?</i>

546
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:36,658
<i>Yeah, I know where</i>
<i>the nursing home is.</i>

547
00:39:36,692 --> 00:39:38,259
<i>If you're moving</i>
<i>through that area,</i>

548
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:40,428
<i>we're going to be talking</i>
<i>about east and westbound Paseo</i>

549
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,063
<i>in that area there</i>
<i>in the North Valley.</i>

550
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:44,532
<i>Please, you've got to avoid</i>
<i>that area as you move through.</i>

551
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:47,168
<i>Our hearts going out</i> <i>to the
victims</i> <i>of this tragedy.</i>

552
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:49,604
<i>We'll bring you more details</i>
<i>just as soon as we get them.</i>

553
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:53,107
<i>Coming up on Coyote 102.5--</i>
<i>Aerosmith, Def Leppard.</i>

554
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,776
<i>Keep it right here</i>
<i>on New Mexico's finest rock.</i>

555
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:32,242
You wanna cook
with a broken arm?

556
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:37,414
Next step, CO2.

557
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:38,848
Do it.

558
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,968
Hey.

559
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:00,537
I better hear them click.

560
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,299
What, you got a problem
with stairs?

561
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,212
Please, please...

562
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:08,310
Gus is dead.

563
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:15,216
We've got work to do.

564
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:14,702
<i>Vámonos.</i>

565
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,089
Uh, he's going to pull through.

566
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:07,692
Yeah?

567
00:45:07,726 --> 00:45:11,495
Yeah, it looked
kind of touch-and-go there

568
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,598
for a while, but he's gonna--

569
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,700
he's gonna make it.

570
00:45:18,169 --> 00:45:19,869
Thank God.

571
00:45:21,038 --> 00:45:22,739
Oh, thank God.

572
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:34,283
You know, still saying
it wasn't the ricin.

573
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,254
I don't understand.

574
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:41,223
Then what was it?

575
00:45:41,257 --> 00:45:43,058
Saying it was most likely

576
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:46,228
a flower called
lily of the valley.

577
00:45:47,863 --> 00:45:50,265
Yeah, it's--
it's, like, common.

578
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:52,600
It's got these
red berries on it

579
00:45:52,635 --> 00:45:54,068
that I guess taste sweet,

580
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:55,503
and sometimes
little kids eat them

581
00:45:55,537 --> 00:45:56,837
and wind up poisoning
themselves,

582
00:45:56,872 --> 00:45:58,706
and that's it,

583
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,641
nothing more.

584
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:08,281
So Gus didn't poison him
after all.

585
00:46:13,655 --> 00:46:15,423
Still, he--

586
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:20,395
he had to go, right?

587
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,401
You're damn right.

588
00:46:25,435 --> 00:46:26,768
Gus had to go.

589
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,944
Um, you know, I should--

590
00:46:38,246 --> 00:46:39,813
I should get back.

591
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:41,181
Andrea's waiting.

592
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:32,071
<i>I'm here at Casa Tranquila,</i> <i>where three
people are dead</i> <i>following an explosion</i>

593
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:35,374
<i>that rocked this elderly care</i>
<i>facility earlier today.</i>

594
00:47:36,844 --> 00:47:38,845
<i>The fireball completely</i>
<i>consumed one resident's room</i>

595
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,047
<i>and damaged common areas</i>
<i>nearby.</i>

596
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:41,348
Walt?

597
00:47:41,382 --> 00:47:42,716
- Tell Dad to turn on his TV.
- Shh.

598
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:43,884
Walt, let me get somewhere
where I can hear you.

599
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:45,953
- Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
- Shh.

600
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,388
Walt?

601
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:48,556
<i>How are you doing?</i>

602
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,658
How am I doing?
How are you doing?

603
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:52,593
I'm, uh...

604
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:56,797
I'm doing quite well.

605
00:47:58,132 --> 00:48:01,001
I'm good.

606
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:03,770
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

607
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:05,305
Gus Fring is dead.

608
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,440
<i>He was blown up along</i>
<i>with some person</i>

609
00:48:07,474 --> 00:48:09,743
<i>from some Mexican cartel,</i>

610
00:48:09,777 --> 00:48:12,346
<i>and the DEA has no idea</i>
<i>what to make of it.</i>

611
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,482
Do you know about this?

612
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,252
<i>Walt?</i> <i>I need you to--</i>

613
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:20,088
It's over.

614
00:48:20,122 --> 00:48:21,489
We're safe.

615
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:36,971
Was this you?

616
00:48:39,908 --> 00:48:41,575
<i>What happened?</i>

617
00:48:43,411 --> 00:48:45,111
I won.
