1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,686
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

2
00:00:01,811 --> 00:00:03,488
Did Jesse really...

3
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:05,908
squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

4
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,882
You didn't hear that from me.

5
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:11,302
I front each of you an ounce.

6
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:14,806
- Badger, what is this?
- A big opportunity.

7
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:42,355
You selling?

8
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:45,947
I don't know what
you're talking about.

9
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:47,631
That's cool.

10
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,553
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling,

11
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:56,763
I could maybe do with a teenth.

12
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:01,684
You're kidding, right?

13
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,594
Dude, I so smell bacon.

14
00:01:05,389 --> 00:01:07,718
What?
What are you talking about?

15
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,414
Gee, I don't know.

16
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:12,109
How about over there.
That brown van.

17
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:16,437
- That's yours, right?
- What brown van?

18
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:19,024
Parked all inconspicuous.

19
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:20,947
It's a cop van.

20
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,047
Another one right over there.

21
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:28,318
"Duke City Flowers"?
Come on!

22
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:30,745
Can't you at least be original?

23
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,359
Dude, I just want to get high.

24
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:34,781
A flower van.

25
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:39,129
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

26
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:41,439
Seriously.
And I don't mean to disrespect.

27
00:01:41,564 --> 00:01:44,189
But if you put a bunch of cops
in the back of a garbage truck,

28
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:46,475
there's no way
I'm seriously thinking

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,600
that there's cops in the
back of a garbage truck.

30
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:52,806
It's a freebie, yo.
Just think about it.

31
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:54,481
Think about it, boys!

32
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,154
All right. I'm hitting it.

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,959
You dudes give up that easy?

34
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:03,284
I'm not a cop.

35
00:02:04,563 --> 00:02:05,963
Then lift your shirt.

36
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:08,338
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

37
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,542
All right, you know what?

38
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,267
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

39
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,551
I'm blinded by white.

40
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:18,130
Douchebag.

41
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:20,355
Come on. I was joking.
Come on.

42
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,470
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

43
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,832
I mean, what are you
complaing about?

44
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:30,144
You got abs, man. Kinda.

45
00:02:30,395 --> 00:02:31,645
Whatever, dude.

46
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:34,362
I'm not even sure
I want to buy anymore.

47
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,132
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

48
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,250
Come on.
Don't be like that.

49
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,447
I just need you
to prove it, you know?

50
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:44,554
Prove you're not a cop.

51
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,129
How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

52
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:49,238
I don't know.

53
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,119
I got it.

54
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:54,733
Go over there and punch
that dude right in the face.

55
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:55,908
Which dude?

56
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:57,702
That dude?

57
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,088
No way.
He'd kick my ass.

58
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,348
True that.

59
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,114
This is so hard, you know?

60
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:11,475
I know.

61
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:13,490
It's simple.

62
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:16,370
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,

63
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,804
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

64
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:20,679
It's in the Constitution.

65
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:22,784
Constitution of America?

66
00:03:26,427 --> 00:03:27,927
So go ahead and ask.

67
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,608
Are you a cop?

68
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:32,718
Not like that.
Ask it, like, official.

69
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:35,047
Are you a police officer?

70
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:39,044
I am not a police officer.

71
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:42,171
Okay, then.
175 for a teenth.

72
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:45,978
The price is the price, yo.

73
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:51,733
All right.

74
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:19,719
There you go. Enjoy.

75
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:22,718
Thanks, man.

76
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,519
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

77
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:34,224
Get on your stomach now!

78
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:36,649
On your stomach, get on the ground!

79
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,421
Hold it, don't move!

80
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:40,589
Stay down!

81
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,651
Synch: Tyno, Michvanilly

83
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:06,374
<i>I had a good job until my boss
accused me of stealing.</i>

84
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:10,294
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

85
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,497
<i>I was out partying,
minding my own business...</i>

86
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,750
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

87
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,660
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

88
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:25,935
<i>Hi. I'm Saul Goodman.
Did you know that you have rights?</i>

89
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,448
<i>The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.</i>

90
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,771
<i>I believe that until proven guilty,</i>

91
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:33,959
<i>every man, woman, and child
in this country is innocent.</i>

92
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,123
<i>And that's why I fight
for you, Albuquerque!</i>

93
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:37,637
<i>Better call Saul.</i>

94
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,762
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law.</i>

95
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,012
I really need to get some furniture.

96
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:51,838
I suggest you start with a bed.

97
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:56,942
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

98
00:05:57,327 --> 00:05:59,677
- Well, you can't.
- I know. I know.

99
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:02,047
I'm just saying.

100
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,261
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

101
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:09,393
You better seriously hope
that airs out.

102
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:12,018
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

103
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:16,167
He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

104
00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:21,810
Has he ever caught you?

105
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:26,664
Many times.

106
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:30,114
Well, listen.

107
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:34,150
Since I already lost
my deposit and all,

108
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,641
maybe we should light up.

109
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,149
You sure?

110
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:48,065
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

111
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:50,412
Maybe you'll change your mind.

112
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,870
Do what you want to do, I guess.

113
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,615
- What'd I say?
- Nothing.

114
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:10,271
I just have to go is all.

115
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,375
What's this?

116
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,074
My 18-month chip.

117
00:07:36,943 --> 00:07:38,993
I'm in recovery.
And you know,

118
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,250
pot is, like,

119
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:43,625
stepping stones.

120
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:47,094
Recovery?

121
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:49,831
That's cool.

122
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:51,386
Right on.

123
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,917
I respect that.

124
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:57,414
You know, I don't really
burn much anymore.

125
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,147
It's just a sometime thing.

126
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:04,368
But no more, like, in the house.

127
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:11,666
So, you want to go grab some dinner?

128
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,989
I could really go for some Chinese.

129
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:15,583
I better hit it.

130
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
We cool?

131
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,126
Your satellite's on, by the way.

132
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:31,345
That screen's bad-ass.

133
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:48,282
I just think it's asking a lot.

134
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,630
He knows it.

135
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:52,277
He's done nothing but apologize.

136
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:56,130
Is this going
to be every weekend now?

137
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:59,205
It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

138
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,709
But I am earning double time.

139
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:03,806
There's a bright side.

140
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,491
So, when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up,

141
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:09,795
tell him he better wash those sneakers.
And I said "Bye."

142
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,575
And tell him to let
them air dry this time.

143
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,800
I don't want them banging
the hell out of my dryer.

144
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:16,968
What?

145
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,847
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

146
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:25,901
You look nice is all.

147
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:28,605
It's work.
Everybody's gonna be there.

148
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:33,387
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

149
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:52,247
<i>Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler, and Walter Junior.</i>

150
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:55,051
<i>Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.</i>

151
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,834
<i>Skyler?
Are you there?</i>

152
00:09:57,896 --> 00:09:59,699
<i>I just don't know what to do.</i>

153
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,638
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

154
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,640
It's me. What's up?

155
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:16,077
Yesterday I got home and found him.

156
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,470
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

157
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:23,477
- A man was killed?
- A federale, right in front of him.

158
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,265
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

159
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:31,585
It's like what you hear about
in Iraq or something.

160
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:34,257
- The IEDs.
- Oh, Jesus.

161
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:37,345
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

162
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:40,473
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

163
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,794
Hank should win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

164
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:46,801
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

165
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:49,119
And all he keeps saying is,

166
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,204
"I'm fine. I'm fine.
Leave me alone."

167
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:18,522
Baby, not now.

168
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,300
It's me, Hank.

169
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:22,828
Sorry.

170
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:28,144
Hey, buddy.

171
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:30,298
What's up?

172
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:34,213
I just...

173
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:36,582
Do you mind if I...

174
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:42,341
So...

175
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:47,661
How you doing?

176
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,045
You know. Lousy.

177
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,501
Montezuma's Revenge, big time.

178
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,026
I mean, everything's
going through me

179
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,327
like crap through a tin horn.

180
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,658
Better not get too close.

181
00:12:01,793 --> 00:12:03,343
I'll take my chances.

182
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:15,352
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

183
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:18,525
Terrible.

184
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,506
What do you expect?
Freakin' animals.

185
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:25,071
Like <i>Apocalypse Now</i> down there.

186
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,250
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

187
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:32,751
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.

188
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:37,835
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

189
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:41,439
You don't put
your second most senior man

190
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:45,316
on the trail of those motherless
bastards, you send him home.

191
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,765
I was, you know,
"He's out getting an evidence bag,

192
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,411
"and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

193
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:55,436
"So must be something wrong
with that picture."

194
00:12:57,926 --> 00:12:59,676
So are you home for good?

195
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:05,979
Playing it by ear.

196
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:08,223
"To be determined."

197
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,706
Think you might want to talk it through
with somebody?

198
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,269
What? A shrink?

199
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,285
I can't.
Start going down that road,

200
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,879
kiss your career goodbye.

201
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:22,902
Or Marie.

202
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:24,974
Or me,

203
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:27,297
if you like.

204
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:36,664
You know, I don't
know how to say this.

205
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:42,505
You know, the things I deal with,

206
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:46,420
you and me don't have much of a...

207
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,110
what you might call
an experiential overlap.

208
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:00,922
What if I told you we do?

209
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,787
I have spent my whole life scared.

210
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:18,396
Frightened of things
that could happen,

211
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:21,277
might happen, might not happen.

212
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:24,278
50 years I spent like that.

213
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:29,605
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

214
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,506
But you know what?

215
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:38,789
Ever since my diagnosis...

216
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:42,436
I sleep just fine.

217
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:52,642
And I came to realize

218
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:56,328
it's that fear
that's the worst of it.

219
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,277
That's the real enemy.

220
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:02,401
So...

221
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,317
get up.

222
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:09,083
Get out in the real world.

223
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:12,743
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can

224
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,318
right in the teeth.

225
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:30,929
Do it again.

226
00:15:31,257 --> 00:15:32,103
Go on.

227
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:43,296
$10,000 even. Same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

228
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:45,723
You and I, we are gonna
feed this machine.

229
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,544
I want it running 24 hours a day.

230
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:48,669
Right on.

231
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,161
Not yours, I take it.

232
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,539
We got 10,

233
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:03,609
20,

234
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,060
30,

235
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:09,706
44.5 each.

236
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:15,568
3 pounds should be 48 each.

237
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:17,655
Who's short?

238
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,576
Don't freak.
We didn't get ripped off.

239
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,763
Badger hasn't
kicked in his full amount.

240
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:25,311
I know he's planning on
pulling an all-nighter,

241
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:28,836
- so he's probably still in the sack.
- Then wake him up.

242
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:31,144
He can sleep after we're paid.

243
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,554
Why you gotta be such a hard on?

244
00:16:33,808 --> 00:16:36,158
You're not his pal.
You're his boss.

245
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:38,743
This only works
when they're scared of you.

246
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:41,115
Jack off.

247
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:47,772
It's going straight to voicemail.

248
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:49,528
Voicemail?

249
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,512
Just chill, okay?
Count your money.

250
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:00,348
Combo,

251
00:17:01,074 --> 00:17:02,374
you seen Badger?

252
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:05,838
Don't you cover for him!

253
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:09,814
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer!

254
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,058
Well?

255
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:32,676
They were too scared to tell me.

256
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:35,679
Badger got busted.

257
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:37,604
He's in jail.

258
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:15,443
Honey, I'm home!

259
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,428
Too slow!
What's up?

260
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:20,912
You've got more lives
than a damn cat.

261
00:18:21,037 --> 00:18:23,537
Now if I can only learn
to lick myself.

262
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:26,203
What's up, guys?
Good to see you.

263
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,321
All right!

264
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:31,352
Let's all go back to work,
for Christ's sake!

265
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,467
In my office, man. Let's see what
you bozos have been up to lately.

266
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
You okay?

267
00:18:59,474 --> 00:19:00,524
Hanging in?

268
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,741
What's it look like?

269
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,130
What's this from APD?

270
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:09,202
I been checking with them to see if they
come across that blue meth of yours.

271
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:11,155
Sure enough, last night.

272
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,474
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

273
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,599
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

274
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,904
Maybe you'd like to go with me.

275
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,380
Well, all right.

276
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:27,294
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

277
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:29,039
I feel manipulated.

278
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,210
I thought we were gonna hang out.

279
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:32,903
We are hanging out, Badger.

280
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:34,878
You like Badger or Brandon?

281
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:40,223
I like people who don't,
like, abuse the Constitution.

282
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:41,868
Badger, listen.

283
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:46,538
I'm trying to help you here, man.

284
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,556
If you just tell me
who your supplier is,

285
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:54,181
I think this can end
very well for you.

286
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:58,720
What are you doing talking to
my client without me present?

287
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,053
You Sneaky Pete!

288
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,810
Which is which?

289
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:05,573
What, did the Academy hire
you right out of the womb?

290
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:07,575
You guys get younger every...

291
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,855
What'd you say to Baby-Face?
Did you say anything stupid?

292
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:13,380
By anything stupid,
I mean anything at all.

293
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:16,179
Look at you. Mouth open,
vocal chords a-twitter.

294
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:18,557
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

295
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,872
Ten minutes ago! Go on!

296
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:24,189
There are laws, detective. Have your
kindergarten teacher read 'em to you.

297
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:27,305
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

298
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:32,619
All right.

299
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:35,074
Who do we have?

300
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,444
Brandon Mayhew.

301
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:40,428
All right.

302
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,601
Here we go.
Public masturbation.

303
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,645
- What?
- I don't get it. What's the kick?

304
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,062
Why don't you do it at home,
like the rest of us

305
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:56,524
with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

306
00:20:56,649 --> 00:20:58,857
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

307
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:00,886
That ain't me, man!

308
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:04,233
I was the guy who was selling meth.

309
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:05,667
Allegedly.

310
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,623
All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

311
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:11,822
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

312
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:14,607
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

313
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,217
And a felony quantity.

314
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,966
- Just barely.
- Yeah, just barely.

315
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:23,559
The cops around here are like butchers,
always got their thumbs on the scales.

316
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:26,034
But good luck arguing that in court.

317
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:28,224
Let me get down to brass tacks.

318
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,358
I'm going to get you
a second phone call.

319
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,607
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy

320
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:35,114
or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader,

321
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:38,757
and they're going to
deliver me a check for $4,650.

322
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,198
I'll write that down
on the back of my business card.

323
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:43,939
4-6-5-0.

324
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,117
And I need that in a cashier's check

325
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,378
or a money order, doesn't matter.

326
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,067
Actually, I want it
in a money order.

327
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:54,034
And make it out to
Ice Station Zebra Associates.

328
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,614
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.

329
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:58,754
It's done just for tax purposes.

330
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:02,133
After that, we can
discuss Visa or MasterCard,

331
00:22:02,258 --> 00:22:05,486
but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask.

332
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,846
Any questions?

333
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,767
You're gonna get me off, right?

334
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:16,773
I look like your high school girlfriend?
Five fingers, no waiting?

335
00:22:17,395 --> 00:22:19,043
That's a joke, Brandon.

336
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:20,218
Lighten up.

337
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:24,077
Son, I promise you this.

338
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:29,117
I will give you the best criminal
defense that money can buy.

339
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:35,113
Francesca, I took these already.
Didn't I take these already?

340
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:38,907
Look, it's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on Vitamin A.

341
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:40,682
It's bad for the liver.

342
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:43,758
Okay, who's next?

343
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:46,667
Did him. I did him.

344
00:22:47,131 --> 00:22:49,577
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

345
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,642
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

346
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,320
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.

347
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,616
Gentlemen, I sense
you're discussing my client.

348
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:02,526
- Anything you care to share with me?
- Sure. Your commercials? They suck ass.

349
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:05,863
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

350
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,823
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

351
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:10,891
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

352
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,192
DEA, huh?

353
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:13,836
For a street bust.

354
00:23:14,182 --> 00:23:17,249
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

355
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:33,685
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

356
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,960
You want your exponential growth,

357
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:38,145
guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

358
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:41,540
So how about we get him a real attorney?
I mean, what the hell is this?

359
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:43,215
This is who he hires?

360
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,284
What?
Are you kidding me?

361
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,781
This is the guy you want.
This is the guy I'd hire.

362
00:23:50,231 --> 00:23:53,077
- It's the guy you'd hire.
- Look, you remember Emilio?

363
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:56,111
This dude got Emilio off,
like, twice.

364
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,651
Both times,
they had him dead to rights, yo.

365
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:01,067
And then poof!

366
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,752
Dude's like Houdini.

367
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,804
Seriously,
when the going gets tough,

368
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:06,949
you don't want a criminal lawyer.

369
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:09,651
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

370
00:24:10,473 --> 00:24:12,023
Know what I'm saying?

371
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:16,197
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

372
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:18,620
Badger's way too loyal to roll.

373
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:20,806
Plus he's scared shitless of me.

374
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:24,930
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

375
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:28,670
And it's only his first dealing rap,
so worst case scenario?

376
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,860
They plead him out, he does five months
picking up litter in an orange jumpsuit.

377
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:36,408
So who goes inside?

378
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:38,749
I don't need them seeing my face.

379
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:41,173
I don't need them seeing my face.

380
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:44,896
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

381
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:45,918
Dick.

382
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:47,637
Fine.

383
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:50,371
We'll flip for it.

384
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:51,779
Call it.

385
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:53,881
Heads.

386
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,695
<i>Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?</i>

387
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:26,170
Mr. Mayhew.

388
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:29,465
Nice of you to come down.
Please.

389
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:31,008
Look at you.

390
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:34,929
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

391
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,716
Joking.

392
00:25:37,331 --> 00:25:38,891
Please, come on.

393
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,141
Come on.

394
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,155
Please.

395
00:25:43,396 --> 00:25:44,546
Saul Goodman.

396
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:45,895
Please sit.

397
00:25:49,072 --> 00:25:53,070
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

398
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:00,707
I believe you have something for me?

399
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:09,213
Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?

400
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:10,644
Irish.

401
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,426
Faith and begorrah!
A fellow potato-eater.

402
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:16,011
My real name's McGill.

403
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:19,321
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

404
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:23,096
They all want a pipe-hittin'
member of the tribe, so to speak.

405
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:26,276
I digress.
Good things are happening.

406
00:26:26,572 --> 00:26:30,037
Fact is,
your nephew's gonna get out in no time.

407
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:31,987
That's wonderful.

408
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:34,908
There's still a few details
to be ironed out,

409
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:36,824
but now that the DEA is involved,

410
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:40,508
I think he's looking at time
served and probation.

411
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:44,290
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

412
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,908
Excuse me, the DEA?

413
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,399
That's the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

414
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,524
The feds.

415
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:55,430
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news,

416
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:59,173
but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

417
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:02,394
I understand that. But what does
that have to do with the DEA?

418
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,270
They're after some mystery man,

419
00:27:04,395 --> 00:27:06,690
some heavy-hitter that goes
by the name Heisenberg.

420
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:09,148
They want this guy like
the ax wants the turkey.

421
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:13,410
Seems young Brandon may have information
that could lead to his arrest.

422
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:15,172
Jesus, cheer up!

423
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:18,906
This is good news. I mean, Brandon
fell head-first into the doo-doo pile

424
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:21,531
and came up smelling
like Paco Rabanne.

425
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:22,965
Look, look.

426
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:27,231
I just think that we should

427
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:29,995
review our options.

428
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:31,805
Options?

429
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,173
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

430
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:36,201
And you got a grand total of two.

431
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:38,238
Option A, Brandon takes the deal.

432
00:27:38,363 --> 00:27:40,637
Option B,
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary

433
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:43,326
and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

434
00:27:43,451 --> 00:27:45,787
Look, look.
What about...

435
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,960
reprisals?
I mean, if Badger...

436
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,561
If Brandon...

437
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,961
informs on this Heisenberg...

438
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:56,924
I mean, what if...
God forbid...

439
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,808
that they decide to...

440
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:01,569
take revenge?

441
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:03,911
What have you been telling him?

442
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:07,804
The kid keeps spouting off about
"if I talk, they'll kill me."

443
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:10,626
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

444
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,839
- Good.
- No, that's not good.

445
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:15,673
That's terrible.
Trust me, sir,

446
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:18,193
your nephew won't last
in prison two weeks.

447
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:20,678
You let him take
his chances on the outside.

448
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:23,147
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

449
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:24,639
No, look, look.

450
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:27,588
These are vicious, desperate people.

451
00:28:28,345 --> 00:28:30,039
I've been told that

452
00:28:30,164 --> 00:28:32,164
one of them killed another man

453
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,920
by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

454
00:28:36,878 --> 00:28:39,628
People love to take
credit for the fun ones.

455
00:28:40,013 --> 00:28:43,166
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

456
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,994
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

457
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:48,723
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

458
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:50,568
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,

459
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:52,292
get him singing like a canary...

460
00:28:52,417 --> 00:28:54,267
all's right with the world.

461
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,910
$10,000.

462
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,352
10,000.

463
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,274
Cash to you.

464
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:20,501
I'm not saying to throw the case.

465
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,476
Just...

466
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:24,658
no talking to the DEA.

467
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,248
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

468
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:33,569
What's it going to be?

469
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:38,346
That dude wouldn't take a bribe?

470
00:29:38,997 --> 00:29:42,007
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

471
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:43,828
"Morally outraged," he said.

472
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:47,503
- Threatened to call the police.
- And Badger's gonna spill?

473
00:29:47,949 --> 00:29:49,642
Like the Exxon Valdez.

474
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,342
So what do we do about it?

475
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:06,704
Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

476
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,029
For safety!

477
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:10,565
What?

478
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:15,529
God, you are killing
me with that booty.

479
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:29,870
Talk to me, guys!

480
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:33,008
Come on.
Just tell me what you want! Jesus!

481
00:30:37,428 --> 00:30:39,987
It wasn't me!
It was Ignacio! He's the one!

482
00:30:46,022 --> 00:30:47,022
Shut up!

483
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:49,264
Shut up!

484
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:51,445
All right, just speak English.

485
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:53,916
Lalo didn't send you?
No Lalo?

486
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,868
- Who?
- Thank God!

487
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,424
I thought...

488
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:04,177
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

489
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:06,471
Anything!
Just tell me what you need.

490
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:10,583
This afternoon, an associate
of ours offered you $10,000.

491
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:12,799
You should have taken it!

492
00:31:12,924 --> 00:31:15,731
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

493
00:31:16,014 --> 00:31:18,400
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

494
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:21,069
The uncle.
That was your guy?

495
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:25,325
No offense, guys, but I don't take
bribes from strangers, you know?

496
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,757
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

497
00:31:27,882 --> 00:31:29,823
But I'll take your money! Sure!

498
00:31:29,948 --> 00:31:31,960
That offer's expired, yo.

499
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:36,079
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

500
00:31:36,576 --> 00:31:38,259
Just tell me what you need.

501
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:40,760
I'm easy.
I'm going to keep a happy thought

502
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:42,883
and assume this is
just a negotiating tactic.

503
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:45,957
All right,
listen to me very carefully.

504
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:49,183
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew the best

505
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,373
legal representation ever.

506
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,680
But no deals with the DEA!

507
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:58,112
All right? Badger will not
identify anyone to anybody.

508
00:31:58,237 --> 00:32:00,409
If he does, you're dead!

509
00:32:02,685 --> 00:32:04,735
Why don't you just kill Badger?

510
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:10,869
Follow me, guys,
but if a mosquito's buzzing around you,

511
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:14,245
it bites you on the ass, you don't go
gunning for the mosquito's attorney.

512
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,407
You go grab a flyswatter.
I mean, so to speak.

513
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:21,171
I mean, all due respect,
do I have to spell this out for you?

514
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,673
We're not killing Badger, yo!

515
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,744
Then you got real problems.
'Cause the DEA is gonna come down

516
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:29,495
on your boy like
a proverbial ton of bricks.

517
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,118
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here,

518
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:35,894
but he's not gonna like prison.
He's gonna sing like Céline Dion

519
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,162
regardless of what you do to me.

520
00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:48,967
I recognize your cough.

521
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,159
Take that mask off.
Get some air.

522
00:32:51,734 --> 00:32:52,624
Go on.

523
00:33:00,703 --> 00:33:04,237
Take it easy!
Breathe in, breathe out.

524
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:08,257
I'm gonna stand up, all right?
'Cause I got bad knees.

525
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:10,724
That's better.

526
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:15,559
Now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

527
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,227
How?

528
00:33:17,717 --> 00:33:21,349
First things first, you're gonna
put a dollar in my pocket, both of you.

529
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:25,152
You want attorney-client privilege?

530
00:33:25,523 --> 00:33:28,321
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

531
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:30,580
I mean it!

532
00:33:30,705 --> 00:33:33,243
Put a dollar in my pocket.
Come on, make it official.

533
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:35,587
Come on, do it!

534
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,958
That's it. Come on.
Just a dollar.

535
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,221
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on.

536
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:47,896
Give with the dollar.

537
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:49,815
- Go on.
- Be smart.

538
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,752
What?

539
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,017
- All I got's a 5.
- I'll take a 5!

540
00:33:57,142 --> 00:33:58,929
Come on, already.
Come on.

541
00:33:59,054 --> 00:34:00,054
Be cool.

542
00:34:02,778 --> 00:34:06,736
You're now both officially represented
by Saul Goodman and Associates.

543
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:10,261
Your secrets are safe
with me under threat of disbarment.

544
00:34:11,577 --> 00:34:14,743
Take the ski mask off. I feel like
I'm talking to the Weather Underground.

545
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:18,580
Do it.

546
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,753
So if a prison shanking
is completely off the table...

547
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:28,528
and we're sure of that?

548
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,093
No shanking!

549
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,132
Then the way I see it is

550
00:34:38,713 --> 00:34:40,535
somebody's going to prison.

551
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:46,316
It's just a matter of who.

552
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:48,952
All right.

553
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:51,545
Lame-ass TV ads aside,

554
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,699
your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

555
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:57,467
Time served, no probation.
He's pretty slick.

556
00:34:57,592 --> 00:35:00,092
Couldn't believe
the judge went for it.

557
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:03,129
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

558
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:06,002
You don't give us the name
of your supplier, you're going nowhere.

559
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:10,442
Agent, the tough guy act is unnecessary.
This young man is cooperating fully.

560
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,463
Is that right?
You cooperating?

561
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,652
Let's start with a name.

562
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:25,293
He just goes by Heisenberg.

563
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:29,818
How old's this Heisenberg?

564
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,444
Old.

565
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:34,288
Like 50 or 70 or something.

566
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:36,935
- Height?
- Average, I guess.

567
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,928
Medium height, medium weight.

568
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,078
What color hair?

569
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:41,737
No hair.

570
00:35:42,198 --> 00:35:43,665
Dude's balder than you.

571
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,062
1963.

572
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:51,116
James Edward Kilkelly is convicted
of stealing a vending machine.

573
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:54,034
1975.
Breaking and entering.

574
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,011
1982. Grand theft auto.

575
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,622
1984. Armed robbery.

576
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:02,450
1987. 1992.
You get the idea.

577
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:04,179
And here he is today.

578
00:36:04,304 --> 00:36:07,397
Better known today as Jimmy In-'n-Out.
City, State, and Federal.

579
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,917
He's spent 44
of the last 58 years inside.

580
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,521
An entire life behind bars.

581
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:17,741
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

582
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,744
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

583
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:22,886
On purpose?

584
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,450
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

585
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:28,562
He's actually more
comfortable inside.

586
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,879
The outside world hasn't
been too kind to him.

587
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:35,185
Sometime during
the Clinton administration,

588
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,060
Jimmy figured out how he could use
his talents to turn a profit.

589
00:36:45,312 --> 00:36:48,396
- When does all this happen?
- It's already happening.

590
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:50,240
The buy is set for tomorrow.

591
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:53,088
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy,

592
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:57,211
and all it's gonna cost you is 80,000
and one pound of your finest meth.

593
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:05,726
$80,000 for eight years
of his life, huh?

594
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,635
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

595
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,965
I'm gonna represent him,
and I guarantee

596
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:14,353
there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

597
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:16,925
Secondly, he gets 30.
50 goes to me.

598
00:37:17,198 --> 00:37:20,136
- You get 50? For what?
- For facilitating.

599
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:23,280
Who's taking a bigger risk?
He likes prison.

600
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:25,614
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

601
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,359
Look, if this option
is too expensive,

602
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:31,901
you can still always...
Badger in the chow line.

603
00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:52,293
Conscience gets expensive,
doesn't it?

604
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,270
All right. There's our boy.

605
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:13,276
Right on time.

606
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:33,052
- Go back.
- What? All right.

607
00:38:46,923 --> 00:38:47,735
So...

608
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,692
what do you think?
Did they see us?

609
00:38:50,901 --> 00:38:52,620
I think we're good.

610
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,128
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

611
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:03,632
Give me those back.
Just give them to me!

612
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,903
Where the hell is Jimmy? He should
have been here ten minutes ago.

613
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:15,028
You think Jimmy's actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

614
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:18,310
There's more
than one kind of prison.

615
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:20,935
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

616
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:23,068
Wait a minute.

617
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:26,541
What? What?
Let me see.

618
00:39:28,272 --> 00:39:30,366
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

619
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,428
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

620
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,329
Time to move?

621
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:42,086
Not till we see the exchange.

622
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:50,896
- What?
- Now he shows.

623
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,493
Okay, let's do this.

624
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:04,936
My God. Jimmy's on the wrong bench.
Crap!

625
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:07,195
We are screwed!

626
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:09,203
What are you doing?

627
00:40:15,303 --> 00:40:17,080
I don't get it.
What's the holdup?

628
00:40:27,738 --> 00:40:29,134
Where's the stuff, man?

629
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:31,719
- Where are we going?
- Just shut up.

630
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:40,058
- Get out. Go stop him.
- The DEA is right there.

631
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:42,667
- If they see me, we're screwed.
- Get out. I'll do something.

632
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:44,532
- What?
- Go!

633
00:40:58,017 --> 00:41:00,123
Hank, I thought that was you!

634
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:01,916
Schrader, I'm blocked.

635
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:04,878
- Not a good time.
- How you doing? Are you feeling okay?

636
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:06,566
Schrader, I'm blocked.

637
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,798
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

638
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:12,234
You're working? Like DEA working?

639
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,449
Is something going down?

640
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,191
Wrong guy! Wrong guy!
Other bench.

641
00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:31,696
- Move your ass now!
- Okay. I'll go and leave you alone.

642
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:35,140
- We'll talk about it later.
- Just floor it! Floor it!

643
00:41:35,604 --> 00:41:38,504
Forward is better?
I'll be out of the way then?

644
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:41,145
I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry.

645
00:41:41,387 --> 00:41:44,460
- I'll leave you alone.
- We'll talk later. Just go.

646
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,282
Where'd he go?
Where the hell'd he go?

647
00:41:49,697 --> 00:41:50,535
Wait.

648
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:52,634
Got him.

649
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:02,268
- Looks like it's going down.
- Take 'em!

650
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:31,068
I think they bought it.

651
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:36,437
Absolutely.

652
00:42:36,562 --> 00:42:38,089
Textbook bust, sir.

653
00:42:38,595 --> 00:42:39,595
Yes, sir.

654
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,157
Looks like we got a full
pound of the blue stuff.

655
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:45,351
And Heisenberg's real name?

656
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:47,156
James Kilkelly.

657
00:42:50,295 --> 00:42:52,845
Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

658
00:43:22,143 --> 00:43:23,493
You weren't home,

659
00:43:23,778 --> 00:43:26,362
so I let the delivery guys in.
I hope that's okay.

660
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:27,537
Absolutely.

661
00:43:37,497 --> 00:43:38,997
So you bought a bed.

662
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,280
What is that? A king?

663
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:48,151
Pillow top?

664
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:26,203
My God.

665
00:44:26,666 --> 00:44:28,767
You really are a chemistry teacher.

666
00:44:33,764 --> 00:44:34,764
You mind?

667
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:41,579
I was terrible at chemistry.

668
00:44:41,704 --> 00:44:44,200
I'm more of a humanities guy.

669
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:47,329
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.

670
00:44:47,454 --> 00:44:51,369
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

671
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,798
My P.I. charged me for three hours,

672
00:44:53,923 --> 00:44:56,545
so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

673
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:01,132
So this is what,

674
00:45:01,853 --> 00:45:02,853
blackmail?

675
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:04,864
I'm your lawyer.

676
00:45:04,989 --> 00:45:08,511
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

677
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,631
I'm not in the shake-down racket.

678
00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:15,147
I'm a lawyer.
Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?

679
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,297
Especially drug dealers.

680
00:45:18,453 --> 00:45:22,303
So what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

681
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:25,636
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

682
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,412
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

683
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:33,743
Is it in your mattress? Is it in
a jelly jar, buried in the side yard?

684
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:37,707
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up,

685
00:45:37,832 --> 00:45:39,975
but he won't be the last.
And if I can find you,

686
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,150
how far behind can the cops be?

687
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:44,268
I don't understand.

688
00:45:44,404 --> 00:45:47,054
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

689
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:51,298
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

690
00:45:52,003 --> 00:45:54,781
I'm no Vito Corleone.

691
00:45:55,582 --> 00:45:58,063
No shit!
Right now, you're Fredo.

692
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,361
But with some sound advice
and the proper introductions, who knows?

693
00:46:02,678 --> 00:46:04,988
I'll tell you one thing,
you've got the right product.

694
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:07,837
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

695
00:46:07,962 --> 00:46:09,516
you're on to something special.

696
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:13,547
And I would like to be a small
and silent part of it.

697
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:18,311
