1
00:00:00,059 --> 00:00:03,083
Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:04,791
The methylamine...
Jesse and I will be

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,731
taking our two thirds
and we're selling it.

4
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:09,449
Full thousand gallons,
not a drop less.

5
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:12,350
Mike's connection won't buy
unless he gets your share too.

6
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:13,631
Absolutely not.

7
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,817
This deal's going down,
but for some reason,

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,442
I don't trust you alone
with the methylamine.

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,194
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

10
00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:27,162
You get your five millions, we
both do, and he gets his methylamine!

11
00:00:27,276 --> 00:00:28,468
Is that true, Walter?

12
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:29,925
Everybody wins.

13
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:54,841
There.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,011
That's them.

15
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:12,108
Your play, Walter.

16
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:14,143
You're on your own.

17
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:31,394
Looks like you're about 1,000
gallons light here, Mike.

18
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:33,396
Where's the juice?

19
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,732
The methylamine isn't coming.

20
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:40,203
Why is that?

21
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:42,171
And who the hell are you?

22
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:43,673
I'm the man who's keeping it.

23
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:46,509
What the hell's this?

24
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:49,195
We had an agreement, right?
We got our deal.

25
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,181
So where's the tank, Mike?
Mike doesn't know where it is.

26
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:55,652
Only I do. And you're dealing
with me now, not him.

27
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,853
Why don't you just cut
to what it is you want,

28
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:00,022
or what you think is gonna
happen here, all right?

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,825
'Cause we're gonna get
what we came for.

30
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,195
That 1,000 gallons of methylamine
is worth more in my hands

31
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,881
than it is in yours or anyone
else's, for that matter.

32
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,884
But I need distribution.

33
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,387
Distribution.

34
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:16,372
That's right.

35
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,875
So if you agree
to give up your cook

36
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,729
and sell my product instead,

37
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:25,214
I'll give you 35 percent
of the take.

38
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:28,884
35 percent?
Wow. Are you kidding me?

39
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:32,221
35-- Mike, please tell
me this is a joke.

40
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,608
You know how far we had to stick our
necks out to get our hands on this cash?

41
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,393
And why the hell
would we want you?

42
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,412
You realize we have
our own operation, right?

43
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:42,081
I know all about
your operation.

44
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:45,501
My partners here tell me
that you produce a meth

45
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:48,955
that's 70% pure,
if you're lucky.

46
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:53,209
What I produce
is 99.1% pure.

47
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,744
So?

48
00:02:57,715 --> 00:03:01,934
So... it's grade school T-Ball

49
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:04,604
versus the New York Yankees.

50
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:08,307
Yours is, uh, just some tepid,

51
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:11,594
off-brand,
generic cola.

52
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:15,598
What I'm making
is classic Coke.

53
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,367
All right. Okay.

54
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,319
So, um,

55
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,622
if we just waste you
right here,

56
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,791
right now,
and leave you in the desert,

57
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:27,376
then there is no more Coke
on the market, right?

58
00:03:27,411 --> 00:03:30,129
See how that works?
There's only us.

59
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:34,116
Do you really wanna live
in a world without Coca Cola?

60
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:47,730
My partner tells me
that your crew

61
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,650
switched to a P2P cook
because of our success.

62
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:53,019
You dye your meth
with food coloring

63
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,687
to make it look like mine.

64
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:59,158
You already ape my product
at every turn.

65
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:00,943
But now...

66
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,362
you have the opportunity
to sell it yourself.

67
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:05,414
I need you to listen to me.

68
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,416
We're not gonna
give up this deal

69
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,536
to be your errand boys,
do you understand?

70
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:12,538
For what?

71
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:14,874
To watch a bunch of junkies
get a better high?

72
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:18,594
A better high
means customers pay more.

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,016
A higher purity
means a greater yield.

74
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:27,336
That's 130 million dollars
a profit

75
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:31,357
that isn't being pissed away
by some substandard cook.

76
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,227
Now you listen to me.

77
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:36,512
You've got the greatest
meth cook in a--

78
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,564
No, the two

79
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:41,150
greatest meth cooks
in America right here,

80
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:43,736
and with our skills,

81
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:46,289
you'll earn more from that 35%

82
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:48,357
than you ever would
on your own.

83
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,526
Yeah. So you say.

84
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,695
Just wondering why
we're so lucky.

85
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,630
Why cut us in?

86
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:57,583
Mike is retiring from our crew,

87
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,303
so his share of the partnership
is available,

88
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:03,472
if you can handle his end--

89
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:05,675
distribution.

90
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,894
And if you give him
five million dollars

91
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:09,896
of the 15 million
that you brought today.

92
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,081
Just think of it
as a finder's fee

93
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:14,317
for bringing us together.

94
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,954
We have 40 pounds of product
ready to ship,

95
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:19,689
ready to go.

96
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:22,992
Are you ready?

97
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,430
Who the hell are ya?

98
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:46,382
You know.

99
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:50,386
You all know exactly who I am.

100
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,256
Say my name.

101
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:56,926
Do what? I don't--

102
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:59,145
I don't have a damn clue
who the hell you are.

103
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:01,931
Yeah, you do.
I'm the cook.

104
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:06,602
I'm the man
who killed Gus Fring.

105
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,072
Bullshit.
Cartel got Fring.

106
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,607
Are you sure?

107
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,135
That's right.

108
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,306
Now... say my name.

109
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:34,430
Heisenberg.

110
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:38,601
You're goddamn right.

111
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:50,668
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

112
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,649
I gotta hand it to you, Walter.

113
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:20,772
Hey.

114
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:23,191
I appreciate the kind words,

115
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,193
but I'm out too,

116
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:27,195
remember?

117
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,563
I know.
We'll talk.

118
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,619
Maybe we should talk
about how and when

119
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,904
I'm gonna get
my five million dollars.

120
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:39,040
And we will do that.

121
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,376
Absolutely.

122
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,428
It's just, you know--

123
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:46,014
Jesse, just give me
some time here, okay?

124
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:48,749
I'll need a little help getting things
up and running during this transition.

125
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,584
You can at least
do that for me, right?

126
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:55,273
Huh? Come on.
Don't worry.

127
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,942
We'll figure it out.

128
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,093
Well, I guess that's it.

129
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,395
Parting thoughts,
of which I have two...

130
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,347
First, as I said,

131
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:38,399
I'll handle the legacy costs
out of my end

132
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,818
so you won't have to worry
about my guys anymore.

133
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,854
Second, the bug.

134
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,990
The DEA will do a sweep.
Can't say when. Could be anytime.

135
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,192
But you need
to get it outta there,

136
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:50,244
sooner rather than later.

137
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,332
All right.

138
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,317
That's it?

139
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,653
No "thanks for
the five million dollars,"

140
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:02,840
no "sorry for chaining you
to a radiator"?

141
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,844
Just get the bug, Walter.

142
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,686
So, hey.

143
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,891
I guess, uh--

144
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:21,976
I guess I'll see you around.

145
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,278
No. Don't think so.

146
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,314
When I'm out, I'm out.

147
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:30,318
Well, I'm out, too, Mike.

148
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,206
Kid...

149
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,708
just look out for yourself.

150
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,253
Are we good?

151
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:24,288
You tell me.

152
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,075
Okay, Jesse.
Back it up.

153
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,579
You're good.

154
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,432
Keep it coming.
Straight back.

155
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,434
Slow it down.

156
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:38,469
All right.
That's good.

157
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:46,644
Hey, Mrs. White.

158
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,826
<i>Vamonos.</i>

159
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:03,995
I wish.

160
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:06,747
All right. Let's get
this thing hooked up.

161
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:09,250
Walt...

162
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,557
What is this?

163
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,593
Do you really wanna know?

164
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:21,812
Why are you hiding it here?

165
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,431
Don't worry about it.

166
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,066
Who are you hiding it from?

167
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,102
I said,
"don't worry about it."

168
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:30,404
From the police?

169
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,241
Or someone else?

170
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,276
Someone who would kill for it?

171
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,612
Why don't you
go back in the office?

172
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,616
Why don't you
go back in the office

173
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,751
and let us do this?

174
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:46,037
We'll get it out of your hair.

175
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,968
Oh! What'd you
bring me this time?

176
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:21,171
They're bacon banana cookies.

177
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:24,457
Is there bacon in these?
Oh, my God!

178
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:26,459
Just bits.
Just little bits of bacon.

179
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,794
Just enough to make
those suckers really pop.

180
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:31,815
Dan, this is too much.

181
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,483
I'm not sharing those.

182
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:35,401
Bad office etiquette?
I don't give a crap.

183
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:37,904
- They're mine. - Well, they're yours
to do with as you please.

184
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:41,024
Good, 'cause my husband's
not getting any either.

185
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:43,359
- How is Mickey?
- Don't get me started.

186
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,361
He wants to buy a boat.

187
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:48,081
I can't even get him
to start the lawnmower,

188
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:50,783
and he wants to buy a boat.

189
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,418
Oh, I don't know.
A boat might be nice.

190
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,337
A little one, maybe.

191
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:57,423
Oh, please. Where would
you even take a boat?

192
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,792
All the way down
to Elephant Butte?

193
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:02,962
Or Caballo.
It's beautiful down there.

194
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:04,547
You can even leave it
at the lake

195
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:06,349
if you don't want
to haul it every time.

196
00:13:06,383 --> 00:13:08,134
We are not buying a boat.

197
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:10,436
I'll tell you that right now.

198
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:14,557
- And the last one is 545.
- 569.

199
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,226
Aw, dang it.

200
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:18,344
- I almost got them all at time.
- Very good.

201
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,363
But actually,
I've got an extra one

202
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:22,532
for you this week--
603.

203
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,817
603. Where is that?

204
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,786
- Right down there.
- Ah.

205
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:32,992
All right.
I'll let you get to it.

206
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:34,694
Thanks, Dot.

207
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,751
Young Kaylee's gonna need
a second safety deposit box

208
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:07,003
if you decide to leave
one more dollar to her.

209
00:15:07,054 --> 00:15:08,287
Mm.

210
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:11,290
How's the rest of it?

211
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:13,393
Oh, it's empty, as usual.

212
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:16,295
The families are pretty
reliable with the pickups.

213
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:18,798
Nobody complaining about
wanting it all at once?

214
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:22,151
Nah, they get it.
Slow and steady wins the race.

215
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:25,855
So I guess this is it
for a while?

216
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:27,306
Mm.

217
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:29,809
Don't worry about the families.

218
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:31,995
They'll keep getting
their deliveries.

219
00:15:40,537 --> 00:15:43,506
<i>I know times
are tight, but it's for the kids,</i>

220
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,709
<i>and your sponsorship</i>
<i>would sure be appreciated.</i>

221
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,678
<i>Yeah. We have</i>
<i>a, um, silver level,</i>

222
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,763
<i>but the gold</i>
<i>and platinum levels</i>

223
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:52,765
<i>really get your name out there</i>

224
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,802
<i>on the banners</i>
<i>and t-shirts.</i>

225
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:57,770
<i>Sure. No.</i>
<i>No, that's not a problem.</i>

226
00:15:57,805 --> 00:15:59,772
<i>No, you call me directly</i>
<i>if things change,</i>

227
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,108
<i>you hear?</i>

228
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:04,944
<i>Gomie, take a brick to my head</i>

229
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:06,946
<i>if I ever have to make</i>
<i>another fun run call.</i>

230
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,898
<i>I'm done.</i>

231
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:11,401
<i>What's up?</i>
<i>Why you smiling?</i>

232
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:13,686
<i>'Cause the Ehrmantraut
warrant just came in.</i>

233
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:15,187
<i>Oh, baby, now we're talking.</i>

234
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:16,873
<i>How quick can you get</i>
<i>your group together?</i>

235
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:18,357
<i>Two, three hours.</i>
<i>Make it two.</i>

236
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,460
<i>We're gonna nail</i>
<i>that son of a bi--</i>

237
00:17:50,918 --> 00:17:53,252
Police!
Search warrant!

238
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,060
Police!
Search warrant!

239
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:02,562
Coming.

240
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:04,313
Hold your horses.

241
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:08,484
Search warrant.

242
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,736
Police!
Search warrant!

243
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:12,872
Police!
Search warrant!

244
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:14,304
Police!
Search warrant!

245
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:16,108
How's that restraining order
working out for you?

246
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:18,161
Uh, if you want me
to read that,

247
00:18:18,195 --> 00:18:20,145
I'm gonna need my glasses.

248
00:18:26,003 --> 00:18:28,654
<i>Too bad you had to make the trip
out from headquarters, Sergeant.</i>

249
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,456
<i>From out of bed, you mean.</i>

250
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,825
<i>When a cop kills himself,</i>
<i>they want a full report.</i>

251
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:38,798
<i>A single contact wound.</i>

252
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:41,050
<i>Powder burn on his temple</i>
<i>and right hand.</i>

253
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:42,552
<i>Suicide, I think.</i>

254
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:44,520
<i>Tell the wagon boys they
can have him. Yes.</i>

255
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:46,522
<i>When I found him,</i>

256
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,641
<i>he-- he was dead.</i>

257
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:58,651
Hey! Perfect timing.

258
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:01,020
Just about to get started.

259
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:04,073
Uh, you know,

260
00:19:04,124 --> 00:19:06,075
if you can get going
on that settling tank,

261
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:08,461
that would be a huge help.

262
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:12,031
We left that stuff in there
too long after the last cook.

263
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:14,366
- Mr. White--
- I mean way too long.

264
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:16,919
Now we have a tremendous
amount of residue.

265
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,705
You know what we need to
invest in is a power washer.

266
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:22,341
Mr. White,
can we just take a second

267
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,376
and talk about all this?

268
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:32,051
Yeah, yeah, sure.

269
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,719
Yeah.

270
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,271
Yeah.

271
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,076
Um-- uh, look, you know what

272
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,112
I think we need to talk about?

273
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:45,114
Is doubling down.

274
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:47,617
- Doubling down?
- Mm-hmm.

275
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:51,003
Cooking 100 pounds a week,
not 50.

276
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:53,005
As in starting
a new lab--

277
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,924
A lab that you'll run.

278
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,910
A cook all of your own.

279
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,680
Why not?
You deserve it.

280
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:03,633
You're every bit as good as me.

281
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:06,585
Well, what do you think?

282
00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:08,587
Mr. White, uh,

283
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:12,942
I think that nothing
has changed for me.

284
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:16,896
I just wanna get my money
and-- and get out.

285
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,984
Jesse, this...

286
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:26,238
What we do...

287
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,912
Being the best at something

288
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:34,914
is a very rare thing.

289
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:37,416
You don't just toss
something like that away.

290
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:42,088
And what, you wanna
squander that potential?

291
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:44,957
Your potential?
Why?

292
00:20:44,975 --> 00:20:47,093
To do what?

293
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:49,095
I don't know.

294
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:50,930
Well, think.

295
00:20:50,964 --> 00:20:53,599
To do what, Jesse?

296
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:59,155
Well, I'll figure it out,
all right?

297
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:01,306
Look at you.

298
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,326
What have you got
in your life, huh?

299
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,745
Nothing. Nobody.

300
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,663
Oh, wait. Yes.

301
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:10,166
- Video games and go-carts.
- Mr. White--

302
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,119
And when you get tired
of that, what then? Huh?

303
00:21:13,153 --> 00:21:16,655
And how soon will you
start using again?

304
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,127
Look...

305
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:23,662
Look, I know how upset you are

306
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,331
about what happened
to this boy.

307
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,352
I am just as upset as you are.

308
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:32,722
Are you? Really?

309
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:37,509
How can you say that
to me? Jesus!

310
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:40,146
I mean, I'm the one
who's the father here.

311
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,482
What, do I have to curl up in a
ball in tears in front of you?

312
00:21:43,516 --> 00:21:45,517
Do I have to lock myself
away in a room

313
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:47,519
and get high
to prove it to you?

314
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:50,072
What happened to that boy
is a tragedy,

315
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,524
and it tears me up inside!

316
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,526
But because it happened, what,

317
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:56,528
am I supposed to just lie down

318
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,530
and die with him?

319
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:00,082
It's done!

320
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:02,084
It makes me sick
that it happened,

321
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:05,037
just like everyone else
who has died in our wake.

322
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,972
What Todd did--

323
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:10,709
You and I have done things
that are just as bad.

324
00:22:10,727 --> 00:22:12,044
Yeah.

325
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:14,046
All the people
that we've killed--

326
00:22:14,064 --> 00:22:17,266
Gale and the rest...

327
00:22:17,317 --> 00:22:19,268
If you believe
that there's a hell--

328
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,271
I don't know if you're into that.
But we're...

329
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:24,723
We're already pretty much
going there, right?

330
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:28,244
But I'm not gonna lie down
until I get there.

331
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:32,748
What, just because I don't wanna
cook meth anymore, I'm lying down?

332
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:35,400
How many more people
are gonna die 'cause of us?

333
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:37,569
No one. None.

334
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:40,289
Now that we're in control,
no one else gets hurt.

335
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,210
You keep saying that,
and it's bullshit every time!

336
00:22:44,244 --> 00:22:46,712
- No.
- Always! You know what?

337
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:49,632
I'm done, okay?

338
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:51,634
You just give me my money,

339
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:54,136
and you and I--

340
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:56,439
we're done.

341
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:02,228
Hmm. Okay.

342
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,730
Why?

343
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,401
Why do you want this money?

344
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,290
Because it's mine.
It's my cut.

345
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:17,042
But isn't it filthy
blood money?

346
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:20,496
I mean, you're so pure.
You have such emotional depth.

347
00:23:20,547 --> 00:23:23,299
No, no, no, no.
You shouldn't touch that dirty money.

348
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,918
I'll save you from that, Jesse.

349
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:28,587
Come on.

350
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:30,256
You want it.

351
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,842
You want it just as much
as I want it.

352
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:35,845
And it's not wrong to want it.

353
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:37,346
Okay?

354
00:23:37,397 --> 00:23:41,233
So stay and work with me,

355
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:44,469
and you can make ten ti--
20 times as much.

356
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:51,744
Whatever, man.

357
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:55,197
You don't wanna pay me,
I don't care.

358
00:23:55,282 --> 00:23:56,699
Yes, you do.

359
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,251
It's on you, all right?

360
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:02,204
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

361
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,673
You're not done.
You're not leaving,

362
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,209
because if you leave,
you get nothing!

363
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:10,796
Do you understand me?
Nothing!

364
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,299
Jesse!

365
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:20,553
<i>Budget for the current fiscal
year for electronic surveillance</i>

366
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:21,854
<i>is 1.5 million,</i>

367
00:24:21,888 --> 00:24:24,490
<i>on par with ATF</i>
<i>and the Marshal Service,</i>

368
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:26,959
<i>but still just a fraction</i>
<i>of FBI totals.</i>

369
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:30,045
<i>We're lobbying congress</i>
<i>for an additional 1.41,</i>

370
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,181
<i>but we're waiting</i>
<i>on action reports</i>

371
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:34,800
<i>to demonstrate we're
actually getting worthwhile results.</i>

372
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,002
<i>Our undercover operations</i>

373
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:39,522
<i>reap the most successful</i>
<i>actionable intelligence,</i>

374
00:24:39,556 --> 00:24:42,224
<i>if you refer to the chart</i>
<i>in appendix four.</i>

375
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:45,344
<i>If ASAC Schrader can tell us</i>
<i>about the surveillance man-hours--</i>

376
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:47,813
<i>Hank?</i>

377
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,565
<i>Hank?</i>

378
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,367
<i>Hank!</i>

379
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:55,237
<i>I think we're going</i>
<i>to wrap this up.</i>

380
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:57,239
<i>If ASAC Schrader</i>
<i>can stay behind</i>

381
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,074
<i>while everyone else clears out.</i>

382
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,410
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

383
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:16,225
<i>You know no one wants</i>

384
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,394
<i>to see you succeed at this</i>
<i>more than me, right?</i>

385
00:25:18,428 --> 00:25:21,096
- Yes, sir.
<i>- I know how good you are.</i>

386
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:24,233
<i>I wouldn't have stuck my neck out
to get you here if I didn't.</i>

387
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,602
<i>But you're not knocking</i>
<i>down doors anymore, Bubba.</i>

388
00:25:26,653 --> 00:25:28,771
<i>You're in charge</i>
<i>of an entire district office,</i>

389
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:30,990
<i>and that comes</i>
<i>with responsibilities.</i>

390
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:33,192
<i>I mean, Hank, basic reports</i>

391
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,494
<i>aren't being filed</i>
<i>in a timely manner.</i>

392
00:25:35,528 --> 00:25:37,413
I'll work on it.
It'll get better.

393
00:25:37,447 --> 00:25:39,832
<i>Yeah, it will, because way
too much time and money</i>

394
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,533
<i>is being spent</i>
<i>on the Fring case,</i>

395
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:43,202
<i>a case which is</i>
<i>essentially over.</i>

396
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:45,087
<i>All this overtime</i>

397
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:47,373
<i>to surveil Michael Ehrmantraut?</i>

398
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,408
<i>That's just money that could</i>
<i>be better spent elsewhere.</i>

399
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:51,093
I understand,

400
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:52,911
but I'm not making
these choices lightly.

401
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:55,414
We've got increased reports
of blue meth on the street,

402
00:25:55,432 --> 00:25:58,250
Fring's gang is still operational,
and Ehrmantraut is involved.

403
00:25:58,268 --> 00:25:59,584
It's that simple.

404
00:25:59,603 --> 00:26:01,586
<i>I believe you.</i>
<i>But so what?</i>

405
00:26:01,605 --> 00:26:03,588
<i>It's one case out of dozens,</i>

406
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,558
<i>and you don't play favorites with it
just because it used to be yours.</i>

407
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:08,560
- I really think that--
<i>- Don't play favorites with it, Hank.</i>

408
00:26:08,594 --> 00:26:10,429
<i>You got a bigger job than that.</i>

409
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:12,431
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>forget the financial cost.</i>

410
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,933
<i>I hear you're personally serving
search warrants out in the field?</i>

411
00:26:14,951 --> 00:26:17,236
That was an error in judgment.

412
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,288
- Won't happen again.
<i>- You're damn right it won't.</i>

413
00:26:19,322 --> 00:26:21,290
<i>I'm just gonna bottom line</i>
<i>this for you.</i>

414
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:24,326
<i>The surveillance budget</i>
<i>for Ehrmantraut is now zero.</i>

415
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:26,412
<i>We clear?</i>

416
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:29,298
Sure. Thank you.

417
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:31,350
- Clear.
<i>- Good.</i>

418
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:33,385
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

419
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:45,514
Yeah?

420
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:48,633
Hey.

421
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:57,242
So, Ramey wanted
to catch up with you?

422
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:59,161
Talk sports and stuff, I guess?

423
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:01,113
Yeah.
Something like that.

424
00:27:01,147 --> 00:27:04,033
No more following Ehrmantraut.

425
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:07,619
Not worth
the financial investment.

426
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:09,838
Well, it's not like
the guy's going anywhere.

427
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:12,324
He's not even bothering
to throw our tails anymore.

428
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:14,343
He's just living
a boring old-man life

429
00:27:14,377 --> 00:27:16,929
like he has nothing left
to hide.

430
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:18,964
And none of Fring's crew
is talking?

431
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:20,632
Not giving an inch.

432
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,718
You sweeten the pot enough?

433
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,021
Zero jail time and an
all-expense-paid trip to Maui?

434
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:28,173
Not that, but close.

435
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:29,841
Nobody wants to bite.

436
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,176
Christ!

437
00:27:31,194 --> 00:27:33,278
They're either the most
loyal crew in history,

438
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:34,947
or someone's
still paying them off.

439
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,281
You still checking
bank records?

440
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:37,700
No one living
beyond their means.

441
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:39,651
Nine perps...

442
00:27:39,685 --> 00:27:41,904
All being represented
by one lawyer.

443
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:44,189
Not unusual
in a case like this.

444
00:27:44,207 --> 00:27:46,191
Yeah, this guy--
What's his name?

445
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:49,078
Daniel Wachsberger?

446
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:52,214
He represents every one
of these douchebags

447
00:27:52,248 --> 00:27:54,533
except for Ehrmantraut.

448
00:27:54,551 --> 00:27:56,868
Can we find out
more about the lawyer?

449
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:59,138
You want me to start
tailing a lawyer?

450
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:01,724
Like the shit ain't deep
enough for you already?

451
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:03,726
Hey, Ramey said we couldn't
follow Ehrmantraut.

452
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,228
He didn't say anything
about anybody else.

453
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,713
Do it.

454
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:11,233
You're the boss.

455
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,129
All right.
Shall we get started?

456
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,131
Now, I know that most of this,

457
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:44,550
or all of this,
is gonna be new to you.

458
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:48,137
But, uh, did you take
chemistry in high school?

459
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:49,471
Just basic?

460
00:28:49,522 --> 00:28:51,807
No.

461
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:53,809
Okay.
That's all right.

462
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,612
As we go, I'll be as
detailed as possible

463
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:58,781
without being overwhelming.

464
00:28:58,815 --> 00:29:01,483
Yes, sir.

465
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:06,038
Look, Todd,
I-I don't need you

466
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:08,657
to be Antoine Lavoisier.

467
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,909
Uh, what I do need

468
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:13,245
is your full effort
and attention.

469
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,581
Listen and apply yourself.

470
00:29:15,615 --> 00:29:18,584
If you do that,
then we just might have

471
00:29:18,618 --> 00:29:21,119
a fighting chance here, okay?

472
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:26,625
- Okay.
- Okay.

473
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:30,312
Well, here we go.

474
00:29:42,525 --> 00:29:46,028
Slowly. Steady.

475
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:03,262
The aluminum helps speed up
the delivery of hydrogen chloride.

476
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:13,138
Gently pour it in.
No spilling.

477
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:55,380
<i>You're gonna like</i>
<i>the Little Schticky,</i>

478
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:57,048
<i>but you're gonna love</i>
<i>the Big Schhticky.</i>

479
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,551
<i>For bigger messes like dust
bunnies under the bed</i>

480
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:01,353
<i>or picking up after...</i>

481
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:42,644
Now...

482
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:45,948
The CO2 freezes the liquid,

483
00:31:45,982 --> 00:31:47,950
crystallizing it,

484
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:51,737
which gives us our
finished methamphetamine.

485
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:56,708
Now all that's left

486
00:31:56,743 --> 00:31:58,710
is to break it up, weigh it,

487
00:31:58,745 --> 00:32:01,496
and we're done.

488
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:04,783
Wow. This is, um...

489
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:06,951
This is complicated.

490
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,953
It's gonna take me
a few more times

491
00:32:08,972 --> 00:32:11,807
to get a grasp on it.

492
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:13,308
Oh, yeah.

493
00:32:13,343 --> 00:32:15,677
It'll take a few more times.

494
00:32:19,015 --> 00:32:21,099
I do all right?

495
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:24,486
You did fine, Todd.

496
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,323
You applied yourself.
That's as much as I can ask.

497
00:32:28,358 --> 00:32:30,359
Now all that's left, I guess,

498
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,361
is to talk money.

499
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:35,247
We can talk money
once I get this right.

500
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:40,002
Hmm.

501
00:32:45,925 --> 00:32:48,677
Morning.
Guess what I have.

502
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:54,216
Cake pops.
They're balls of cake on a stick.

503
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:58,387
Very nice.
Thank you, Dan.

504
00:32:58,438 --> 00:33:00,939
See? I put little faces
on them.

505
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:24,496
Hey.

506
00:33:26,466 --> 00:33:27,916
Hey.

507
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:45,934
All right.

508
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,509
Mm.

509
00:34:12,428 --> 00:34:15,764
I'm, uh-- I'm working
with a new guy now.

510
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:19,518
And I think that it...

511
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:21,603
I think it

512
00:34:21,637 --> 00:34:24,689
could possibly work out,

513
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:26,525
because...

514
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:34,366
I'm trying, Hank.
I really am. I'm trying,

515
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,985
but there's this...

516
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:41,206
I mean, it's like I don't
even exist to her.

517
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,743
Well, yeah...

518
00:34:44,777 --> 00:34:46,411
I mean,
I know she's struggling.

519
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:48,330
I know, but I-- I--

520
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:49,881
I just don't know what to do.

521
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,917
I mean, what can I do?

522
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:54,469
Such a mess.

523
00:34:55,972 --> 00:34:57,722
I mean, we--
both of us-- we--

524
00:34:57,757 --> 00:35:01,292
we just have screwed up
so much.

525
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:05,147
I'm just...

526
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:06,798
I'm sorry. I don't...

527
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:09,184
Um, do you-- do you have any coffee?
Maybe I could--

528
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:10,852
Coffee? You bet.
Yeah. You bet.

529
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:12,354
What, you take, uh,
cream, right?

530
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:13,738
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

531
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:50,108
All right.
Here you go buddy.

532
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:52,010
- Oh, thank you, Hank.
- Yeah.

533
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:55,013
Look, I'm sorry to waste
your time with all this.

534
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:57,115
- Ah, no.
- It's really...

535
00:35:57,149 --> 00:35:59,150
- It's... You know.
- Yeah.

536
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:01,036
Yeah.

537
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:06,858
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

538
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:08,577
Hey, could you excuse me?

539
00:36:08,628 --> 00:36:10,962
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.

540
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:12,714
- Tell me something good.
- You tell me.

541
00:36:12,748 --> 00:36:14,382
I sweated the guy for 14 hours.

542
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:15,884
That should be
some kind of record.

543
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:18,202
Quit your bragging.
What'd you get?

544
00:36:18,221 --> 00:36:21,706
He's gonna do it.
He's gonna flip.

545
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:23,708
He's willing
to give us Ehrmantraut?

546
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:28,930
What are you wasting
your time for?

547
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,932
Go throw a net around
that son of a bitch.

548
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:32,434
All right.

549
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:05,087
- Yeah?
<i>- Mike, hey, it's me.</i>

550
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:06,755
<i>- Can you talk?</i>
- I can.

551
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:09,675
<i>Great. Look, there's a small
situation with the money.</i>

552
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:11,826
<i>I don't want to do this</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

553
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:13,328
<i>Are you available?</i>

554
00:37:13,346 --> 00:37:15,330
I can come by in a few hours.

555
00:37:15,348 --> 00:37:17,799
<i>That's not good for me.</i>
<i>Where are you now?</i>

556
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:20,335
I'm at the park
with my granddaughter.

557
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,221
<i>- Where exactly?</i>
- Palomita.

558
00:37:23,272 --> 00:37:24,723
<i>Oh, you know what?</i>
<i>I'm not far.</i>

559
00:37:24,774 --> 00:37:26,391
<i>I'll come to you.</i>
<i>You just hang tight.</i>

560
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:36,851
Yeah?

561
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:38,987
<i>Mike, they're coming for you.
Right now. They're coming.</i>

562
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:41,206
- Slow down, Walter. Who?
<i>- The DEA.</i>

563
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,692
<i>The DE--</i>
<i>Somebody flipped.</i>

564
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,712
<i>They have, uh, some--</i>
<i>some kind of bank surveillance.</i>

565
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:48,697
<i>And something</i>
<i>about some lawyer.</i>

566
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:52,000
<i>Someone is talking, Mike, and
they're coming for you right now.</i>

567
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,936
How could Mike use
that clown of a lawyer?

568
00:38:44,971 --> 00:38:46,888
Dan Wachsberger.

569
00:38:46,922 --> 00:38:50,258
He would've had better luck with the
law firm of Moe, Larry and Shemp.

570
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:53,028
Always consult with me
before using outside counsel.

571
00:38:53,062 --> 00:38:55,430
All right, Saul.
Enough, please.

572
00:38:55,448 --> 00:38:57,816
Instead of just sitting
around here, what can we do?

573
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:01,453
Besides pray that he gets away?
I'm open to ideas.

574
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:03,705
Because if the DEA
catches up with him,

575
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,108
and he flips,
it's good night, John-boy.

576
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:10,829
No. No way Mike
would ever flip, okay?

577
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,964
- No way.
- Yeah, yeah.

578
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:15,300
Never say never.

579
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:18,887
This is the second time
the DEA has confiscated his bankroll.

580
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:20,555
You know?

581
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,624
Jesus, fool me once, right?

582
00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:23,958
Look, he won't flip.

583
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:27,596
But his nine guys will.

584
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:46,832
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
It's him.

585
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:50,452
Uh, Mike,

586
00:39:50,486 --> 00:39:53,004
uh, I got you on speaker phone
with the brain trust.

587
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,790
<i>- The what?</i>
- The, uh...

588
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:56,675
Walt and Jesse are here.

589
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:58,343
<i>I don't want Walt</i>
<i>and Jesse, Saul.</i>

590
00:39:58,377 --> 00:40:00,679
<i>- I want you. I need your help.</i>
- What do you need?

591
00:40:00,713 --> 00:40:03,014
I got a go-bag
at the airport--

592
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:05,684
passports, money--
but there are eyes everywhere.

593
00:40:05,718 --> 00:40:07,435
I can't get close.

594
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,504
I need you to pick up that bag

595
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:11,640
and get it to me
as soon as possible.

596
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:14,476
Do you know how thick the crap storm
is out there because of this?

597
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,645
I told you not to use that lawyer.
He's a hack!

598
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:19,281
- Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
<i>- Hey, Mike,</i>

599
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:20,816
I can get it to you, all right?

600
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,685
- Just tell me what to do.
<i>- No, kid. Not you.</i>

601
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:26,955
I'm paying Saul.
He can do the job just fine.

602
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,658
Yeah, you're paying me,
and the DEA knows I represent you,

603
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:31,660
so they're probably
sitting on my car right now,

604
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:33,712
hoping I do something stupid.

605
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:35,864
Mike, I can do it, okay?
It's not a problem.

606
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:36,882
No, Jesse.

607
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,216
Jesus, I'll do it.

608
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,836
Besides, you're out, remember?

609
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,871
Mike, tell me where
to get this bag.

610
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:58,847
Hello, Walter.

611
00:42:00,516 --> 00:42:02,751
Before I hand this over,

612
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:04,286
I need something from you.

613
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,687
And what's that?

614
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:07,923
The names of your nine men.

615
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:10,725
Why?

616
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,261
You're never gonna pay them off.
What's the point?

617
00:42:13,295 --> 00:42:16,514
The point is, Mike,
it affects me.

618
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:20,101
It affects Jesse, too,
and we deserve to know.

619
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:23,104
The only thing left
to do now is leave town.

620
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,606
You understand?

621
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,808
"Leave town." Wow.

622
00:42:26,842 --> 00:42:30,645
Yeah, I just can't up and
leave, like you, Mike.

623
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,148
I've got a family.
I've got people who depend on me.

624
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,117
Yeah.

625
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:53,601
Good-bye, Walter.

626
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:58,373
You're welcome!

627
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:04,145
I'm sorry, what?

628
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,698
I want those names, Mike.
You owe me that much.

629
00:43:06,732 --> 00:43:08,700
I don't owe you a damn thing.

630
00:43:08,734 --> 00:43:12,520
All of this, falling apart
like this, is on you.

631
00:43:12,538 --> 00:43:14,022
Wow.

632
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,957
Wow!

633
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:19,044
Oh, that's some kind of logic
right there, Mike.

634
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:22,247
You screw up, get yourself
followed by the DEA,

635
00:43:22,298 --> 00:43:24,582
and now, suddenly,
this is all my fault?

636
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:26,251
Why don't you walk me
through this, Mike?

637
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:29,304
We had a good thing,
you stupid son of a bitch!

638
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:31,756
We had Fring.
We had a lab.

639
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,676
We had everything we needed,
and it all ran like clockwork.

640
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,678
- Oh, my God.
- You could've shut your mouth,

641
00:43:36,712 --> 00:43:39,931
cooked, and made as much
money as you ever needed.

642
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:43,551
It was perfect.
But, no, you just had to blow it up.

643
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:46,220
You and your pride
and your ego!

644
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:48,523
You just had to be the man.

645
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:51,192
If you'd done your job,
known your place,

646
00:43:51,226 --> 00:43:53,411
we'd all be fine right now!

647
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:09,747
I just...

648
00:46:09,798 --> 00:46:12,133
I just realized
that Lydia has the names.

649
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:14,419
I can get them from her.

650
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:21,142
I'm sorry, Mike.

651
00:46:22,678 --> 00:46:26,014
This-- this whole thing
could've been avoided--

652
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:28,566
Shut the fuck up.

653
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:33,938
Let me die in peace.
