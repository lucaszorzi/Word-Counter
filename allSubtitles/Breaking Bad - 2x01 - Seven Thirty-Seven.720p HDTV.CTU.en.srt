<i>Last season on</i> Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:05,130
Chemistry is the study of change.

3
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:07,151
You understood what
I've just said to you?

4
00:00:07,276 --> 00:00:08,954
Lung cancer. Inoperable.

5
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:12,619
We're family.
We get through these things together.

6
00:00:12,876 --> 00:00:14,639
You want to cook crystal meth?

7
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:17,933
That's right. You know the business.
And I know the chemistry.

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,539
You want to make some cash for
your people before you check out.

9
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:28,543
That's why you're doing all this.

10
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:35,200
I don't know what's been going on
with you lately...

11
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:38,383
I'd say that looks like meth,
but it's... it's too damn white.

12
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:40,444
We got new players in town.

13
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:42,459
This... is unacceptable.

14
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:46,044
We have to move our product...
wholesale. How do we do that?

15
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:49,142
Some guy named Tuco.
A bad ass, from what I hear.

16
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:52,385
- 2 pounds. Next Friday.
- Can you handle 4 pounds?

17
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,596
Methylamine...
They got it locked down tight.

18
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,639
Why don't we
just steal it ourselves?

19
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,892
People sometimes do things
for their families.

22
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:46,911
What is this? It's blue.

23
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:52,390
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

24
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,317
May be blue, but it's the bomb.

25
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:05,987
Tight, tight, tight... Yeah.

26
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,758
Blue, yellow, pink...

27
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,372
Whatever man,
just keep bringing me that.

28
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:22,717
You're all right. We're gonna
make a lot of money together.

29
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:26,107
Just remember
who you're working for.

30
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,717
What did you say?

31
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:34,061
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

32
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,772
Like they don't already know that?

33
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,609
Are you saying that they're stupid?

34
00:03:41,636 --> 00:03:43,511
No, I'm just saying.

35
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:46,782
Oh yeah, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

36
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,645
So, I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

37
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,242
Is that it?

38
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:53,218
Is that what you're doing?

39
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:54,674
Tuco.

40
00:03:58,277 --> 00:04:00,191
Why don't we all just...

41
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:02,047
relax?

42
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,140
Heisenberg says, "relax."

43
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,477
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

44
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:16,973
I'm relaxed...

45
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,381
Damn, man!
Look at that! Look!

46
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:36,776
Yeah. That's messed up.

47
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,136
Okay, Heisenberg!

48
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:42,579
Next week.

49
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,354
Adjusting for inflation...

50
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:40,632
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation,

51
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:44,839
say $45,000 a year.
Two kids, four years of college,

52
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:47,205
$360,000.

53
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,389
Remaing mortgage on the home,

54
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:52,521
107 thousand.

55
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:56,016
Home equity line, 30 thousand.
That's 137 thousand.

56
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,380
Cost of living,

57
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:00,583
food, clothing, utilities,

58
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,381
say two grand a month,

59
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,505
and that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

60
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,941
24K a year.

61
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,022
Provide for say,

62
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:12,511
10 years.

63
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,872
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 1, 3, 7...

64
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,196
737.

65
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,317
$737,000.
That is what I need.

66
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,479
That's what I need.

67
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:33,365
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week,

68
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,558
that's only 10½ more weeks.
Call it 11...

69
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:40,732
11 more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

70
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,783
It's do-able.
Definitely do-able.

71
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,283
Heisenberg!

72
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:38,776
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

73
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:41,334
What's the matter with you?

74
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,221
You can't take an ass-beating,
bitch?

75
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,091
- Damn, Tuco...
- Shut up.

76
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:49,858
There's no pulse.

77
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,638
- Do something.
- Do something?

78
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,072
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

79
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,780
Do something!
You're smart, right?

80
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,673
Do that... Do that thing!

81
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,932
No, there's... There's nothing.

82
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:09,202
- Breathe into his mouth...
- No, they don't teach that anymore.

83
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:11,073
- It doesn't work.
- You, come here!

84
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,124
Breathe into his mouth!

85
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:53,321
Get rid of him.

86
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:55,671
We can't do him like that, man.

87
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,536
Buzzards and rats and all that.

88
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,544
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

89
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:08,589
It sounds like arguing.

90
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:44,337
Gonzo, hurry up!

91
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,414
What's the big hurry?

92
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,536
I just think we're done here.

93
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:32,345
You're done.

94
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:55,406
Hey, I'm back here!

95
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,187
Hello?

96
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,787
Didn't you hear me?

97
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,626
Hey, yourself.

98
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:52,188
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

99
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:57,396
Are you okay?

100
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:00,618
Great.

101
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:06,827
New hat?

102
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,997
I got some grilled chicken
at Albertson's.

103
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:17,718
You want me to heat some up for you?

104
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,165
Where've you been?

105
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,731
Do you know what,
I've got all this crap on my face.

106
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:26,907
Let me clean up first, okay?

107
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,656
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so...

108
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:37,405
Enough.

109
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,919
Hold up.

110
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,352
Stop it.

111
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,270
Stop it!

112
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:35,684
I know you're scared,

113
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:40,858
and you're angry, and you're frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

114
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,730
But you cannot

115
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:45,960
take it out on me.

116
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:54,584
Hey, I'm home!

117
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,706
We are dead.

118
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,201
Dead, man!

119
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,930
<i>Muerto! Ormuerte!</i>
However the hell you...

120
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,329
- This is conjecture.
- This is conjecture?

121
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:22,821
- Yes. And conjecture isn't helping.
- My conjecture isn't helping. Fine.

122
00:17:22,946 --> 00:17:24,667
Facts then. Fact A:

123
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,671
My phone rang, like, eight times last
night. Dead air, hang ups every time.

124
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,927
Second fact:

125
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:32,070
3 in the morning, I saw that black Caddy
of his cruising my neighborhood.

126
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:33,617
If he wanted to kill us,

127
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:37,739
- he would've done it at the junkyard.
- What is that? Conjecture?

128
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:39,760
Are you basing that
on that he's got a normal,

129
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:41,463
healthy brain or something?

130
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:45,539
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

131
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:49,096
And that way... that way
he just kept staring at us,

132
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:50,147
saying,

133
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,091
"You're done."

134
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:54,162
"You're done"?

135
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,773
You wanna know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

136
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:59,693
That means exactly
how it sounds, yo!

137
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,585
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

138
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,968
Right now, Tuco's thinking,
"Yeah, hey,

139
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:08,397
"they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

140
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,811
What happens when he decides no?

141
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,268
It's him or us! You understand?
It is him or us!

142
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:39,848
How would you do it?

143
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:41,935
- What do you mean?
- Specifically,

144
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:44,540
how would you do it? Step by step.

145
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:47,881
All right.

146
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:49,928
Say we...

147
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,988
set up one last sale,
this is providing

148
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:55,017
he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

149
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,513
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always...

150
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,894
tests the product, right?
So,

151
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:02,891
as his head is down...
you know, just giving it a snort...

152
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:05,978
So three shots?

153
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:09,857
- Three shots, or, I don't know, two.
- But is it two, or is it three?

154
00:19:10,294 --> 00:19:13,093
- Two would probably work, I guess.
- Two shots in the chest?

155
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,815
- Or in the face?
- Come on...

156
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,614
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

157
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:23,977
All right. We'll put a pin in that.
But by now,

158
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:26,993
the big guy, Gonzo... he's probably
coming at you, right?

159
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:30,511
So you turn toward him...
How many shots for him?

160
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,898
He's a big guy, right?
How many shots does that take?

161
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:35,278
- I don't know. Three shots.
- Okay, three shots.

162
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:39,386
Tuco and Gonzo. Two men down.
Now, is there anyone else there?

163
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:43,876
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

164
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,452
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

165
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:52,754
All right.

166
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:56,777
So we'll put a pin in that one, too.

167
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:59,138
Now, at this point,
how many shots have been fired?

168
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:03,063
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

169
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,270
How can you suggest

170
00:20:20,673 --> 00:20:24,264
that we kill a man,
and you can't even open the gun?

171
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,560
It's not that easy, is it?

172
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:30,924
Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

173
00:20:51,436 --> 00:20:52,788
Call Skyler.

174
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:04,382
<i>Hey, there. You've reached Walt,
Skyler, and Walter Junior.</i>

175
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:07,641
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave us a message.</i>

176
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:10,585
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already.

177
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,450
The big lug and I are gonna go try

178
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,648
that new restaurant
over by UNM tonight.

179
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,498
So let me know
if you guys wanna hang.

180
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:19,484
Listen to me. "Hang."

181
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,560
Walt Junior would be proud.

182
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:23,291
I know the lingo.

183
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,866
I'm still hip.

184
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,914
It's Chinese... the restaurant.

185
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:31,247
I don't know.
I just feel like Chinese.

186
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:34,169
Do you think that people in China

187
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,756
ever just feel like American?

188
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:39,024
You know, and they go out

189
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,983
and get little take-out boxes

190
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:45,063
with mashed potatoes and meat loaf,

191
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:49,307
and try and figure out
how to use the little knives and forks?

192
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,816
I wonder if that ever happens.

193
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:55,031
All right. I'll let you go.
So call me.

194
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:58,831
Skyler didn't pick up?

195
00:22:00,383 --> 00:22:02,070
Obviously she's not home.

196
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:15,349
What was that about Chinese?

197
00:22:15,474 --> 00:22:17,586
Dinner tonight.
That new place.

198
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,113
- How late they serve?
- I don't know.

199
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:23,193
You got Dave at 8.

200
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:27,174
Not tonight.

201
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:30,223
- Yeah, you do. Remember?
- No, that's Thursday.

202
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,581
I'm pretty sure that's Thursday.

203
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,688
Remember how, at the last minute,
they changed it around for you?

204
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:40,149
They were gonna charge us a penalty.

205
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,444
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

206
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:46,577
And I'm doing them, Hank. I said
I would do them, and I'm doing them.

207
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:50,202
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

208
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,620
Look out!

209
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,502
Sorry, Mr. Schrader!

210
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,825
Look, it's...
You know, it's just...

211
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:09,323
I think Dave is...

212
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:11,809
really helping you.

213
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,704
Sorry about that.

214
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,971
She's...

215
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:52,465
Where's my phone call?

216
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,268
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest.

217
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:00,808
- And then he says, "Give me a four."
- Gomez.

218
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:03,019
What do you got for me?

219
00:24:03,144 --> 00:24:04,984
Come on. Chop-chop.

220
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,529
Good morning to you, too.

221
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:14,678
APD sent this over.
This was about eight or ten days ago.

222
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:17,687
- You know Southwest Aniline, right?
- Yeah, off the 25?

223
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:21,333
- Whole place smells like feet.
- This is them. Check this out.

224
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,551
- Holy shit. What was that?
- Thermite.

225
00:24:26,676 --> 00:24:28,232
So they tell me.

226
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,426
Burns about 5,000 degrees.

227
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:32,535
Kind of stuff you see
on a <i>James Bond</i> movie.

228
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Nice!

229
00:24:34,028 --> 00:24:36,057
Guys who know their trade.

230
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:41,271
Wait. I take that back.

231
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:45,589
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

232
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:49,112
Try rolling it, morons!
It's a barrel.

233
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,156
It rolls. Jesus.

234
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:56,244
- So what'd they get?
- Methylamine, 30 gallons.

235
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,924
P2P?

236
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,667
They're cooking
old-school biker meth.

237
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:04,937
Who the hell still does that?

238
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:07,464
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

239
00:25:08,794 --> 00:25:10,557
Pseudo's in short supply,

240
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:13,632
so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

241
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,134
That and the thermite...

242
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,410
I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

243
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:21,194
But ranking them as burglars?

244
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,974
Shit! I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

245
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:27,849
They got book learnin'
but no street skills.

246
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:30,254
Maybe they're college kids...

247
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:32,359
chem students trying
to make a big score.

248
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:33,284
Maybe.

249
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:37,132
I tell you,
30 gallons of precursor...

250
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:40,330
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

251
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:43,124
Tell you what,

252
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:47,824
they better pray it's us who catches up
to them and not those boys from Juárez.

253
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:12,948
Your daughter wants out.

254
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,262
<i>Hey, there.</i>

255
00:27:44,387 --> 00:27:46,498
<i>You've reached Walt, Skyler,
and Walter Junior.</i>

256
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,444
<i>We can't come
to the phone right now,</i>

257
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:50,519
<i>so please leave us a message.</i>

258
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,047
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

259
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,879
<i>I thought I'd try you
earlier this time,</i>

260
00:27:55,004 --> 00:27:56,545
<i>before you go out and, you know,</i>

261
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,396
<i>face the day.</i>

262
00:27:58,617 --> 00:28:00,310
<i>I'm realizing now</i>

263
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,145
<i>it probably takes you a little longer
to get to the phone,</i>

264
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,683
<i>owing to the extra baby weight...</i>

265
00:28:08,797 --> 00:28:09,949
Hey, sweetie.

266
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,655
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

267
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,618
No, no.
Well, not all of it.

268
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:28,240
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of...

269
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:30,342
My stomach, you know?

270
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:34,779
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't want to wake you.

271
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,097
How would he know where I live?

272
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:06,661
- You're sure it was Tuco?
- Who else could it be?

273
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:10,882
Did you ever tell him my name,
where I live or anything...

274
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:13,356
What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

275
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:15,861
- Did you tell them anything about me?
- I didn't say jack!

276
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:18,836
Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

277
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,134
He's got his ways and means, yo.

278
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,309
Sources, all right?
He's closing in.

279
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,112
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

280
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:32,861
Oh, God.
What happens then?

281
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:42,473
Look, it's got five bullets.

282
00:29:42,926 --> 00:29:44,513
I finally figured out how to...

283
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:47,100
Look, I just finally...
I figured it out.

284
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,977
Say we get a second gun,
right, for you.

285
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,956
I mean, don't we, like,

286
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,174
double our chances?

287
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,085
I mean, mathematically.

288
00:29:58,269 --> 00:29:59,919
I've got a better idea.

289
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:03,084
Thank God!

290
00:30:03,894 --> 00:30:05,129
All right.

291
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:07,353
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

292
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
Beans.

293
00:30:11,714 --> 00:30:12,792
Beans?

294
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:15,819
They're castor beans.

295
00:30:16,975 --> 00:30:19,442
So what are we gonna do with them?

296
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,295
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk, huh?

297
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,863
Climb it and escape?

298
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:27,511
We are going to process them
into ricin.

299
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:30,328
Rice and beans?

300
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:33,737
Ricin.

301
00:30:33,975 --> 00:30:36,076
It's an extremely effective poison.

302
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,980
It's toxic in small doses.

303
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:40,672
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

304
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:42,725
All right.

305
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,572
- So...
- Don't touch them.

306
00:30:48,004 --> 00:30:50,910
Wait. Seriously,
you can get poison from beans?

307
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:52,739
Back in the late'70s,

308
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:55,664
ricin was used to assassinate
a Bulgarian journalist.

309
00:30:57,412 --> 00:30:59,805
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella

310
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,194
to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

311
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,363
And we're talking about an amount not
much bigger than the head of a pin.

312
00:31:06,718 --> 00:31:08,807
But it killed him?

313
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:16,089
Now we just need to figure
out a delivery device,

314
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:17,489
and then...

315
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,420
no more Tuco.

316
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,306
How you doing?

317
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,844
Is this...
This a bad time?

318
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,275
No, come on in.

319
00:32:23,027 --> 00:32:25,587
I should've called first.
I'm sorry.

320
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:28,549
What can I do for you?

321
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:34,386
Maybe we ought...

322
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:37,433
You want to sit down first?

323
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:39,602
I don't know, Hank.

324
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:43,179
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

325
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:47,468
Did she send you?

326
00:32:48,554 --> 00:32:49,778
Hell, no.

327
00:32:50,388 --> 00:32:52,488
She's barely even talking to me.

328
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:54,794
That's why I'm here, okay?

329
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,686
Self-preservation.

330
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:58,007
Big time.

331
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:03,139
Look,

332
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:06,545
I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

333
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:08,539
- I get it.
- Gals...

334
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:10,566
And I need to get involved

335
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:13,427
like I need a second hole in my ass.

336
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:16,995
But if you could do me this huge favor
and just return her phone calls.

337
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:18,567
I don't...

338
00:33:20,012 --> 00:33:22,061
think I'm quite ready
to do that yet.

339
00:33:22,186 --> 00:33:24,355
You know, communication.
Communication, right?

340
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,221
The back, the forth.
Come on.

341
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:28,267
Sky, do this for me, please.

342
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:29,927
You can yell at her.

343
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:31,811
Just call her back.

344
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:39,995
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

345
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:43,290
That's right.

346
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,504
That "baby tiara"
she gave me at the shower?

347
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:50,430
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's.

348
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:54,614
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

349
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:56,136
And Marie won't admit it.

350
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:58,571
She won't apologize.

351
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:05,249
Yeah. If I thought you were gonna
return it, I would have never...

352
00:34:05,374 --> 00:34:06,530
You know.

353
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,849
You knew about this?

354
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,335
We're working on it.

355
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,996
I mean, she's got
this therapist, Dave.

356
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:25,305
- I mean, Dave is really good.
- Dave's good.

357
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,261
But it's an ongoing process, Sky,

358
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:31,488
and we have gotta be understanding.

359
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:35,013
You know? I mean, we've gotta...
You know. We've gotta...

360
00:34:35,292 --> 00:34:37,303
support the shit out of her.

361
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:40,976
Do we?

362
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:45,019
I need support.

363
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:47,768
Me!

364
00:34:48,229 --> 00:34:50,448
The almost 40-year-old
pregnant woman,

365
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:52,276
with the surprise baby on the way.

366
00:34:53,002 --> 00:34:55,024
And the husband with the lung cancer

367
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:57,896
who disappears for hours on end,
and I don't know where he goes,

368
00:34:58,021 --> 00:35:00,399
and he barely even speaks
to me anymore.

369
00:35:00,524 --> 00:35:03,181
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

370
00:35:03,306 --> 00:35:05,259
And the overdrawn checking account.

371
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:08,943
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap

372
00:35:09,068 --> 00:35:12,254
and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet

373
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:14,136
and we can't even afford to fix it.

374
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:16,982
But, oh, I see!

375
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:19,784
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please.

376
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:22,598
"What can I possibly do
to further benefit

377
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,686
"my spoiled, kleptomaniac
bitch sister

378
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:28,859
"who somehow always manages
to be the center of attention!

379
00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:31,949
"'Cause God knows she's the one

380
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:34,777
"with the really
important problems!"

381
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,920
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

382
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:27,329
That's all it takes?

383
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,543
That's all it takes.

384
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,969
So, now what?

385
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,951
Now, we arrange our next meet,

386
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:40,989
in a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

387
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,684
Business as usual.

388
00:36:43,182 --> 00:36:45,937
And, uh, after we sell him
our usual four pounds,

389
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:48,089
then we'll pull this out.

390
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:51,422
"By the way, Tuco,

391
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:53,858
"the new meth formula
we've been working on.

392
00:36:53,983 --> 00:36:55,751
"Would you care to try it?"

393
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:57,526
Okay, well, what's new about it?

394
00:36:58,831 --> 00:37:01,382
Just in case he asks.
What do we say?

395
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:03,505
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

396
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,342
It gets the user insanely high.

397
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,334
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

398
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:12,082
That degenerate snorts
anything he gets his hands on.

399
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:16,240
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

400
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,854
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,

401
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,875
maybe 72,

402
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,595
it'll look like natural causes.

403
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,666
What, like a heart attack?

404
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:31,665
Or the flu, maybe.

405
00:37:32,023 --> 00:37:34,921
His associates won't know
any differently,

406
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,218
and we'll be in the clear.

407
00:37:37,998 --> 00:37:40,072
Not if Tuco kills us first.

408
00:37:58,802 --> 00:38:00,379
Just keep it down.

409
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:02,132
Hey, Hank. What's up?

410
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:04,259
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

411
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:08,680
You been home yet?

412
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,144
Why?

413
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:13,644
<i>Well...</i>

414
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:17,211
'Cause I really screwed up.

415
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:20,645
<i>I apologize in advance for the earful
you're gonna hear from Skyler.</i>

416
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,871
<i>I'm just trying to get her
and Marie talking again.</i>

417
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:26,154
Big mistake.
I should have just kept out of it.

418
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:27,895
<i>Yeah, well, okay.</i>

419
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:30,967
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

420
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:32,685
<i>Well, that happens.</i>

421
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,962
It's no problem.
No worries.

422
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:37,292
<i>Well, thanks, man.
I appreciate that.</i>

423
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:40,689
Jesus, the wives, huh?

424
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,606
<i>Hank, unfortunately,</i>

425
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:46,272
- I really...
- <i>Oh, yeah, man, don't let me keep you.</i>

426
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,404
Actually, I'm at work, so...

427
00:38:52,474 --> 00:38:54,118
You wanna see
something really freaky?

428
00:38:54,243 --> 00:38:57,187
- Well, I would, but...
- <i>Seriously, Walt, this is...</i>

429
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:02,580
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

430
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,668
Hang on, hang on.
It should be coming through right now.

431
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:15,181
Guess it could be worse, huh?

432
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:18,208
We could be having a day
like these two.

433
00:39:19,297 --> 00:39:21,420
<i>A couple of local bulletheads.</i>

434
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,548
Guess they pissed off the wrong guy.

435
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,787
<i>Walt, you there?</i>

436
00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:39,357
- I'm taking this.
- No! It's my gun! I need it!

437
00:39:39,482 --> 00:39:41,563
No, you don't!
Not if you leave town.

438
00:39:41,688 --> 00:39:45,324
Get out of here. Tuco killing Gonzo
means he's coming after us next.

439
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:48,095
I've gotta get home. My family.

440
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:38,913
Where's Walter Junior?

441
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:42,352
Having dinner at Louis's house.
Supposedly.

442
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:48,984
All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

443
00:41:52,937 --> 00:41:54,957
So where have you been this time?

444
00:42:36,632 --> 00:42:39,484
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

445
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:55,017
I'll be right there.

446
00:43:04,742 --> 00:43:06,834
I recognize these two knobjobs.

447
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:10,921
Known associates of a psychotic piece
of shit named Tuco Salamanca.

448
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:13,160
Guess he got tired of associating.

449
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:17,009
- Do you mind if I get in there?
- No, go ahead.

450
00:43:23,662 --> 00:43:25,775
The big one smells fresher.

451
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:29,049
You guys find a death wound?

452
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:35,576
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

453
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:39,658
You done taking pictures?

454
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,995
All right.
Let's lay 'em out flat.

455
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,812
Let me get out
of your way here, man.

456
00:43:58,201 --> 00:43:59,487
Oh, snap!

457
00:43:59,882 --> 00:44:02,639
Damn, Ricky. Leave something
for the coroner.

458
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:14,406
Oh, this is beautiful.

459
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:19,842
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.
We've got the world's dumbest criminal.

460
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:22,284
This guy wasn't murdered.
Look.

461
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,134
Big Stuff, here,
was moving this guy's body,

462
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:29,052
when the stack must have shifted.

463
00:44:30,388 --> 00:44:32,833
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,

464
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,005
and he bled out!

465
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,563
Poetic justice.
Oh, I love it.

466
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:38,907
Don't you just?

467
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,026
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

468
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:45,182
Old Stumpy, here. Make sure
you get the stump in there.

469
00:44:53,378 --> 00:44:55,173
Would you talk to me, please?

470
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:05,202
I don't know where to begin.

471
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,761
What the hell are you doing here?

472
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,338
Get in.

473
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,139
Get in.

474
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:41,255
Let's go.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
