00:00:01,853 --> 00:00:03,442
Do you have a second cell phone?

3
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:06,797
How does Albuquerque Liaison,
Interdiction Task Force sound?

4
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:08,382
Like one hell of a promotion.

5
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,471
- Your dad?
- Owns the place. I manage it.

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,224
Pen on paper, that's what I need.
Or go run your game somewhere else.

7
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:20,428
I want you to handle it.

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,563
I want my money and my dope!

9
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,233
I ain't no skank.

10
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:27,978
Skank, skank...

00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,208
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,

14
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,741
which, in turn...

15
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:21,321
You do know what a bond is?

16
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:27,198
A strong force of attraction.

17
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,688
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

18
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:35,624
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds?

19
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:39,860
Chemical bonds

20
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:43,222
are what make matter matter.

21
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:48,037
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together,

22
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,900
what hold us together.

23
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:52,464
I got it.

24
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,667
Bonds.

25
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,505
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

26
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:02,885
I mean, 58. I was close.

27
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:09,891
What is close?

28
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:12,987
There's no "close"
in science, Barry.

29
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,397
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

30
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:18,192
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

31
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:22,288
I'm just saying,
Mr. White, 2 points?

32
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,659
If I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

33
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:30,568
I mean, I really studied. Like,

34
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,870
really, really studied, like,

35
00:05:34,612 --> 00:05:35,862
all night hard.

36
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:39,086
I'm so into chemistry for, like,

37
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:41,913
the concepts.
I just think I might have

38
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:44,790
the attention deficit.

39
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,555
Couldn't you please
just let this slide?

40
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:00,498
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

41
00:06:04,283 --> 00:06:07,029
The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

42
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,604
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

43
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:55,967
Are you ducking me or what?

44
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,091
This makes the third time.

45
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,732
Look, I will be

46
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:04,273
leaving this phone on
for another 15 minutes, so call me.

47
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:05,648
And by the way,

48
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,401
that thing we talked about?

49
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:11,248
When I said "handle it"?

50
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, don't.

51
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:15,696
Let it go.

52
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:17,733
All right.

53
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:41,370
Open the door.

54
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,354
I know you're home.
Your car is here. Come on.

55
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:54,348
Can I help you?

56
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:01,522
I'm the manager, so can we stop
with the pounding, please?

57
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:04,044
You're the manager?

58
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,693
You can help me.
Absolutely.

59
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:10,212
I very much need to get inside here.

60
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:13,737
So if you have a master key...
You have a key, right?

61
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,619
Yeah, I have a key.

62
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:20,660
Look, the person who lives here,

63
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:24,253
it's just very important
for me to see him.

64
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:26,004
And you knocked, right?

65
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:28,951
He didn't answer?

66
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,642
Which means?

67
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:37,933
Look, I'm his father, all right?

68
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:39,726
You're Mr. Jackson?

69
00:08:42,348 --> 00:08:44,169
That's me. Walt Jackson.

70
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,276
- And you are?
- Jane.

71
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:51,398
Very nice to meet you, Jane.
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

72
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,473
Mr. Jackson, I'm happy
to let you use my phone.

73
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:55,701
Want to call him?

74
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,419
As I said, I would like
to have you let me inside here

75
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,620
so that I can check
on my son's well-being.

76
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,399
You understand?

77
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:13,168
Look, whatever's going on
between the two of you is family.

78
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,247
I don't get involved in family.

79
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:18,640
Jesse doesn't want you in,
you're not getting in. Period.

80
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,914
Sorry.

81
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:26,758
Come on in...

82
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:28,098
Dad.

83
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,156
You okay?

84
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:46,308
Jesse Jackson?

85
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:48,464
Do you even...

86
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,959
I see you have a telephone at least.

87
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:57,604
You know, that blinking thing
I've been calling you on?

88
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,080
Whatever, man.

89
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,091
- Give me my...
- I will break this! I will break this!

90
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:08,229
Damn druggy idiot.

91
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:11,836
Is this what you've been doing the whole
time I've been trying to reach you?

92
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,646
I've been taking care of business.

93
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:16,971
- What business?
- What business?

94
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:20,298
The business you put me on, asshole.

95
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,079
You already forgot?

96
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:30,724
This business.

97
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:34,803
Does that jog your memory?

98
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,290
Son of a bitch.

99
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:45,262
- You didn't actually...
- You said "handle it."

100
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:46,770
So I handled it.

101
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,096
When I said "handle it,"
I meant fear and intimidation.

102
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,517
Get your money back.

103
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:55,301
- I certainly never meant for you...
- You didn't mean to kill somebody?

104
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,531
Too late, yo, because dude's dead.

105
00:10:57,786 --> 00:10:58,786
Oh, God.

106
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,575
- All right? Way dead.
- Oh, God.

107
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,243
Here.
Here's your money.

108
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:10,380
4,660 bucks.

109
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:12,045
Your half.

110
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:16,550
Spend it in good health,
you miserable son of a bitch.

111
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:49,122
I didn't say I killed him.

112
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:53,253
Tell me what happened.

113
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,479
The dude's wife crushed his head

114
00:11:57,604 --> 00:11:59,028
with an ATM machine.

115
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:04,021
- Crushed his...
- Crushed his head with an ATM machine.

116
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,908
Right in front of me.

117
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:07,968
I mean, crushed it like...

118
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,298
Oh, my God, the sound...

119
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:14,522
It's still in my ears.

120
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:17,555
You know, and the blood,
like, everywhere.

121
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:21,437
Like, there was so much,
you would not believe.

122
00:12:23,252 --> 00:12:25,603
Man, will you just please give me...

123
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:28,376
give my weed, all right?

124
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:30,201
It helps with my nausea.

125
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,798
So,

126
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,889
you did not kill anyone.

127
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:41,450
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

128
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:42,975
I called the cops.

129
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:45,315
You called the cops?

130
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,678
I called and I split,

131
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,937
and then they came in
and busted her.

132
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:55,889
God, she was
so zapped out of her mind.

133
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,091
She did it for, like, nothing.

134
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:03,865
He told her she was a skank, but,
I mean, she was a skank.

135
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,369
Can this person identify you?

136
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,808
Can she identify you being there?

137
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:13,474
Dude, she couldn't identify
her left ass cheek.

138
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:15,998
She was so zonked.

139
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:19,793
And she had this...

140
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,676
God, she had this kid.

141
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,583
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
on the mechanics, here.

142
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:31,476
But could you not stop this woman
from killing this man?

143
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:35,439
Look, she had
a gun on me, all right?

144
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:44,345
Yeah, my gun, okay?
Mine.

145
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,799
Go ahead.
Say it.

146
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:51,182
I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
I can't run a crew.

147
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:54,440
Come on.
Point made, man. Point made.

148
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,555
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

149
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:06,644
<i>It's Badger, man.</i>

150
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,014
<i>What are you doing?
Don't use your real name.</i>

151
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,683
<i>What? That isn't my real name.</i>

152
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:17,619
<i>We got those pants you wanted.</i>

153
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:19,311
<i>32 large, right?</i>

154
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:21,884
<i>We got them just for you,</i> jefe<i>.</i>

155
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,478
<i>Let's do some bid-ness, yo.</i>

156
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:35,290
So, are you going
to get back up on that horse?

157
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:41,021
You get on.

158
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,541
All right?

159
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:44,669
I just want to forget.

160
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:56,435
Sorry.

161
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:13,055
What's up with that?

162
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:15,417
Jesús Malverde.

163
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,874
Patron saint
of Mexican drug dealers.

164
00:15:18,268 --> 00:15:20,505
Hell, I know who it is, okay?

165
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,505
Scumbags kneeling down,
praying to him...

166
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,185
"Please, <i>Señor</i> Saint-ay!

167
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,667
"No DEA, please!"

168
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,580
I'm just saying
why is he on your desk?

169
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:43,984
Going after neo-Nazis,
you don't wear swastikas, right?

170
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:47,779
Sun Tzu.

171
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:49,178
Sun who?

172
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:52,576
Sixth century Chinese general.
Wrote <i>The Art of War</i>.

173
00:15:53,514 --> 00:15:55,282
"If you know your enemies yourself,

174
00:15:55,407 --> 00:15:58,248
"you'll fight without danger
in many battles."

175
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:02,919
Right on.

176
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:11,845
- Agent Schrader.
- Sir!

177
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,175
Glad to have you on board.

178
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:20,085
- Everybody getting you settled in?
- Great group of guys.

179
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:21,970
And gals.

180
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,006
Got guys...
Guys and gals.

181
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,906
That's good. You couldn't have picked
a better time to arrive.

182
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:28,905
About to put a big dent
in the cartel.

183
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,930
- Right, Vanco?
- Yes, sir.

184
00:16:59,242 --> 00:17:00,549
Bro, check it out.

185
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:03,224
It's a satellite picture
of you farting.

186
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,590
Fat Man and Little Boy.

187
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:07,176
Sounds like you two.

188
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:10,064
I got your Fat Man
in my pants, bitch.

189
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:16,651
Watch it.

190
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,252
It ain't real, dumbass.

191
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:19,573
Watch it, is all.

192
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,897
You watch it.

193
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:32,974
I'm Heisenberg.

194
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:35,816
You're Heisenberg?

195
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,306
I remember you.
You were the cook.

196
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:40,767
Let's get this over with.

197
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:42,517
Where's Jesse?

198
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:44,312
Busy.

199
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:45,939
That's cool.

200
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:47,484
Real cool.

201
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,883
Totally cool.

202
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,904
It's all there. Every dollar.

203
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,613
In case you want to, like, count it.

204
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:56,783
Here?

205
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,689
I'm just saying...

206
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,325
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.

207
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,084
We ain't got no confusion and
interpretation as to who we work for.

208
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,566
Man, that's church, yo.
For real.

209
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:14,869
What have you heard?

210
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:18,946
Did Jesse really...

211
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:23,317
I mean, did he really...

212
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,010
squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

213
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:36,838
Who's saying that?

214
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:38,913
Damn, man, it's all over town.

215
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:40,988
Everybody's like, whoa, snap!

216
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:44,178
Usually I got to chase dudes
down for their money. But today,

217
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:45,903
everybody's paying up.

218
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,915
True that.
Serious.

219
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:50,374
But, like...

220
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:53,775
he really did it?

221
00:19:03,716 --> 00:19:05,666
You didn't hear that from me.

222
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:35,154
Big lunch.

223
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:54,934
- Here you go.
- Very good, Miss White.

224
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,111
We'll consider your
application and let you know.

225
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,784
I'd just like to mention
that I have worked here before.

226
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:03,822
Really?

227
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:05,562
When are you due?

228
00:20:08,325 --> 00:20:10,675
- Several months.
- Congratulations.

229
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,318
I see.
Accounting department.

230
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:16,214
You left us four years ago?

231
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,841
Family.

232
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:22,095
We'll definitely let you know.
Thank you for coming by.

233
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:30,067
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?

234
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:31,729
I think he'll remember me.

235
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:34,732
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
unfortunately.

236
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,700
If it's okay, I'll just...

237
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,129
Ma'am.

238
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,919
Oh, my God, look at you.

239
00:20:58,044 --> 00:20:59,044
Hey, Ted.

240
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:00,885
Come in.

241
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:03,840
No calls, Margaret.

242
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,997
Sit down right here.

243
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,521
You look great.

244
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,575
A boy or a girl,
or are you keeping it a secret?

245
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,820
It's a little girl.
We're very excited.

246
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,820
I'll bet.
One of each.

247
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:25,944
How's Walt Jr.?

248
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,096
Tenth grade and
he's just growing like a weed.

249
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:31,831
He's taller than I am now.

250
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:37,372
I'm betting 6'3", 6'4"
by the time he's finished.

251
00:21:38,023 --> 00:21:40,219
Wow, handsome.
Oh, my God.

252
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:42,383
Good genes.

253
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:49,742
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

254
00:21:51,474 --> 00:21:52,685
Yep, that's them.

255
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,984
- They're gorgeous.
- Yes, they are.

256
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:57,033
And they know it.

257
00:21:58,005 --> 00:21:59,859
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

258
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,902
So, the big office?

259
00:22:08,232 --> 00:22:09,544
Weird, isn't it?

260
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:12,415
I still think of it as my dad's.

261
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:14,018
I miss him.

262
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,375
Me, too.

263
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:19,152
I'd like to think he'd be proud.

264
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:22,006
Last year was our best year yet.

265
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:23,817
He'd be proud.

266
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:28,135
Walt, how's he doing?

267
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:31,030
He is doing great.

268
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:33,208
He's plugging away.

269
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:34,262
Great.

270
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,961
He still teaching?

271
00:22:37,176 --> 00:22:40,906
- You tell him I said hello.
- I will definitely do that.

272
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:47,740
To be honest, Ted,

273
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:50,459
I didn't just stop by to say hello.

274
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,358
I was applying
for the data entry job.

275
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,316
You're kidding.

276
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:01,045
You were like our go-to book keeper.

277
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:06,185
The economy, you know, so...

278
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,138
Well, data entry,
that'd be a mistake.

279
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:15,169
How about...

280
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,855
get your old job back?

281
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,799
We're expanding and...

282
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,447
between you and me, that whole
department is pretty much of a mess.

283
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:30,716
Your work would be cut out
for you. But...

284
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:33,131
we could use your help.

285
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,672
Now, this is our territory, right?
Currently.

286
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,634
Hello?

287
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:51,046
- Correct.
- All right, then. Now, look at this.

288
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:52,930
Here, here, here and here.

289
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:56,413
What does that look like to you?

290
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,897
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

291
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:04,667
Look.
It's an entire city full of buyers.

292
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:06,652
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

293
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:10,434
- Because it's not our territory.
- Because we lack initiative.

294
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,951
- Initiative?
- You need to employ more dealers.

295
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,747
Double, triple your crew.

296
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,696
Those three I met...
they should each have three, six,

297
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:21,085
nine sub-dealers working for them.

298
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,211
Exponential growth...
that's the key.

299
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,306
It's not our territory.

300
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:28,130
Man, you follow me, here?

301
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:31,740
We go rolling into
these neighborhoods,

302
00:24:31,865 --> 00:24:34,136
other crews ain't
going to take kindly.

303
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:37,463
- You understand?
- Sure. They won't like it.

304
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:41,206
But I say they're not going
to do a thing about it.

305
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:42,748
Listen, Jesse.

306
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:48,639
The game has changed.
The word is out.

307
00:24:49,343 --> 00:24:51,422
And you are a killer.

308
00:24:53,113 --> 00:24:56,458
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently it's all over town.

309
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,933
Somebody crossed you.
You got angry.

310
00:24:59,257 --> 00:25:02,007
You crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

311
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:04,725
- But that's not how it happened.
- Who cares?

312
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,423
Just as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police.

313
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,298
- My God.
- Don't you see how great this is?

314
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:14,931
Look, you are a...

315
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,576
Jesse, look at me.

316
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:23,702
You... are a blowfish.

317
00:25:24,912 --> 00:25:27,209
- What?
- A blowfish. Think about it.

318
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:30,749
Small in stature,
not swift, not cunning.

319
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,565
Easy prey for predators.
But the blowfish

320
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,408
has a secret weapon, doesn't he?

321
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:40,332
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?

322
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,081
What does the blowfish do?

323
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:46,975
- I don't know...
- The blowfish puffs up.

324
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,089
The blowfish puffs himself up four
or five times larger than normal.

325
00:25:51,214 --> 00:25:53,273
And why?
Why does he do that?

326
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,658
So that it makes him intimidating,
that's why.

327
00:25:56,783 --> 00:25:57,889
Intimidating,

328
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,267
so that the other scarier fish
are scared off.

329
00:26:01,495 --> 00:26:03,795
And that's you.
You are a blowfish.

330
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:06,949
You see? It's just all an illusion.

331
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:09,757
See? It's nothing but air.

332
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:12,987
Now,

333
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,548
who messes with the blowfish, Jesse?

334
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:19,955
- Nobody.
- You're damn right.

335
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:24,799
- I'm a blowfish.
- You are a blowfish.

336
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:26,922
- Say it again.
- I'm a blowfish.

337
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:29,797
- Say it like you mean it.
- I'm a blowfish!

338
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:30,922
That's it.

339
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:33,991
Blowfishing this up.

340
00:27:14,136 --> 00:27:16,786
The SkyMall.
Give me the SkyMall, would you?

341
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:25,713
Vanco, new guy don't speak Spanish.

342
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:27,346
What's up?

343
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,340
Hey, white boy,

344
00:27:30,935 --> 00:27:32,733
better learn <i>Español</i>, huh?

345
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,237
This ain't Branson, Missouri.
You know what I'm talking about?

346
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:38,183
You know what?

347
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:39,753
I'll teach you.

348
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,578
It means

349
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:46,785
"Let's make a deal."

350
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,288
So go ahead.
We're waiting.

351
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:52,795
<i>Vaya, vaya.</i>

352
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,090
Right here.

353
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:59,205
Item SS4G.

354
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:03,643
Yankee Stadium, "Final Season"
Commemorative Baseball,

355
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,292
hand-signed by Derek Jeter.

356
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,354
Vanco, write this down.

357
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:10,792
Man, watch out.

358
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:14,362
661OOZBG.

359
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,861
Large size floor runner.

360
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,179
Look at that.

361
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:20,281
It's a rug you put on the floor,

362
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:23,479
except for it looks like
a hundred dollar bill.

363
00:28:23,604 --> 00:28:25,661
I love them.
Get me 20 of them.

364
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,883
I'm going to put them
all over my <i>casa</i>.

365
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:29,206
We'll get you three.

366
00:28:29,556 --> 00:28:31,459
- You give me ten.
- Five.

367
00:28:35,037 --> 00:28:37,587
How about you stop
jerking us off, here?

368
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,677
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

369
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,933
White boy don't like
"Let's make a deal."

370
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:50,965
White boy's going to kick your ass,
you don't stop wasting his time.

371
00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:52,210
Schrader...

372
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:53,443
White boy.

373
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:55,568
My name's Tortuga.

374
00:28:56,377 --> 00:28:58,127
You know what that means?

375
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:02,703
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole".

376
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,966
"<i>Tortuga</i>" means "turtle."

377
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,660
That's me.

378
00:29:11,353 --> 00:29:12,603
I take my time,

379
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:14,886
but I always win.

380
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,030
That reminds me.
Wait, I seen this earlier, lookit.

381
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,854
This is awesome, homes.

382
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:27,515
Right there.
Look at that.

383
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:30,748
The Tranquil Tortoise
garden sculpture.

384
00:29:30,993 --> 00:29:32,686
Definitely two of those.

385
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,595
Check it out.
<i>Mira.</i>

386
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,960
Good likeness.

387
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,556
Hank's doing great down there.
He's really making inroads.

388
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:43,187
I'm sure he is.
He's a hero, after all.

389
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:47,187
- So, you going to go down to El Paso?
- Please.

390
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:50,980
It's third-world enough around here.
They keep him busy every second.

391
00:29:51,105 --> 00:29:53,857
He's already got some big operation
going, some kind

392
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:56,650
of hush-hush deal. He couldn't
tell me a thing about it except

393
00:29:56,775 --> 00:30:00,005
- it's on the other side of the border.
- That sounds exciting.

394
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:02,477
He's being safe, right?

395
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,907
He says he's mostly riding a desk, which
between you and me, is how I want it.

396
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,116
Speaking of riding desks...

397
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:14,019
I got myself a job today.

398
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:16,856
You did not.

399
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,521
As big as you are?

400
00:30:23,796 --> 00:30:24,796
Thank you.

401
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,307
You know I just mean...

402
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:29,025
Where?

403
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:33,081
With who? Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

404
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,487
- Beneke.
- You did not.

405
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:41,277
- Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?
- It was one time at a Christmas party,

406
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:43,642
and he was so drunk he was

407
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,956
practically slurring his words.

408
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,827
- Just what you want in an executive.
- And he apologized profusely.

409
00:30:49,952 --> 00:30:53,559
Plus, he's married. He doesn't want
to get sued for sexual harassment.

410
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:54,933
It will not...

411
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:56,822
happen again.

412
00:30:58,547 --> 00:30:59,815
Is money that tight?

413
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:07,656
You know we can always help out.

414
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:13,945
You know Walt.
He would just...

415
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,260
Speak of the devil.

416
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,995
How are you?
What's up?

417
00:31:23,306 --> 00:31:26,200
- Nothing much. How's things with you?
- Good.

418
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:29,846
- Dinner will be about an hour. And...
- Thanks, honey.

419
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,886
- Everything okay?
- Everything's perfect.

420
00:31:54,257 --> 00:31:56,199
This is Raisin Bran,

421
00:31:56,952 --> 00:31:59,652
- not Raisin Bran Crunch.
- So? Same thing.

422
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:01,880
Not the same thing.

423
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:05,089
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you do the grocery shopping?

424
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:08,374
And then you can get
whatever you want. Great!

425
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:12,513
It's not that hard, Mom.

426
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:16,391
- It says "crunch" on the box.
- You're pushing it.

427
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:17,516
Morning.

428
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,489
Morning, honey.

429
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:23,694
Dad, notice anything?

430
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,695
Is there a funeral today?

431
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,315
A funeral?
Christ, do I look that bad?

432
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:34,008
Mom got a job.

433
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:35,853
A job? Why?

434
00:32:36,836 --> 00:32:39,786
Do I need to get out the checkbook
and show you?

435
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:42,477
Is this a good idea
in your condition?

436
00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:45,452
The doctor said I can work
practically up until I go into labor.

437
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:48,507
And it's just an office job.
I'm just sitting on my butt.

438
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:51,156
Where?

439
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:53,473
Beneke.

440
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:56,997
I'm back working
in the accounting department.

441
00:32:58,673 --> 00:33:01,914
What about the welding fumes? Isn't that
why you had to quit in the first place?

442
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,008
They've gone green since then.

443
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:07,826
They have some kind of green
welding or something.

444
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:10,529
I didn't smell anything
when I was in there.

445
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:14,656
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?

446
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:18,314
- Who's running things?
- Ted.

447
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,663
The son.

448
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,937
Anyway, I have got to go.

449
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:28,800
I don't want to be late
my first day back.

450
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,797
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

451
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,100
You left your cave.

452
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,431
I was kind of missing my TV.
I was thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.

453
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:08,405
Snag a big-ass wide screen.

454
00:34:09,955 --> 00:34:10,772
So...

455
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:15,386
What you drawing?

456
00:34:18,645 --> 00:34:19,446
Damn.

457
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:20,986
That's good.

458
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,018
It'd make a hell of a tat.

459
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:25,267
- That's the plan.
- Really?

460
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:28,215
I work part-time down at ABQ Ink.

461
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,067
Right on.

462
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:34,534
You're a real good drawer.

463
00:34:35,436 --> 00:34:37,436
I used to do a little of that.

464
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,555
You used to be a drawer, too?

465
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:46,555
What stopped you?

466
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:51,706
You know, just...

467
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:53,904
So, tell me something.

468
00:34:54,523 --> 00:34:56,673
What kind of tattoo artist has...

469
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:58,169
no tattoos?

470
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:02,775
That's way too big a commitment.

471
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:15,404
You're Pinkman.

472
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:20,904
You're the man!
Everybody's been talking about you.

473
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:24,246
Right on, man.
Keep it real.

474
00:35:34,872 --> 00:35:36,972
I thought your name was Jackson.

475
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:55,360
Your snitch has really
earned his nickname.

476
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:58,793
Are we just on<i> mañana</i> time?

477
00:35:58,918 --> 00:36:00,068
They'll show.

478
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:02,644
Why's that?

479
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:06,052
You got more catalogs
for him to clean out?

480
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:09,555
You know, Sharper Image
or Pottery Barn?

481
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:37,832
Something I need to know about?

482
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:39,186
What? That?

483
00:36:40,417 --> 00:36:42,717
We were just, singing your praises.

484
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,974
Glad to have you.

485
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:46,349
Welcome aboard.

486
00:37:07,272 --> 00:37:08,732
Is that your guy?

487
00:37:10,498 --> 00:37:12,198
I think that's your guy.

488
00:37:14,072 --> 00:37:16,472
What the hell
is he doing down there?

489
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,760
Where you going?

490
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,573
We need an evidence bag, right?
Pretty big one.

491
00:38:31,718 --> 00:38:33,094
What's the matter?

492
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:36,355
You act like you never saw a severed
human head on a tortoise before.

493
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:50,011
Welcome to...

494
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:16,834
God damn, my leg.

495
00:39:39,765 --> 00:39:41,426
The game has changed.

496
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,207
This is our city.

497
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:46,211
All right? All of it.

498
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,986
The whole damn place.

499
00:39:48,111 --> 00:39:49,496
Our territory.

500
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,097
We're staking our claim.

501
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:55,250
We sell when we want, where we want.

502
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:58,690
We're going to be kings.
Understand?

503
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:03,400
I'm going to be king and you guys
will be princes or dukes or something.

504
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,278
- I want to be a knight.
- First thing's first.

505
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:08,530
We got to get more dealers.

506
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:10,424
Foot soldiers.

507
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:11,537
Right?

508
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,483
Now they'll be working for you.

509
00:40:13,608 --> 00:40:16,538
You're working for me,
and they're working for you.

510
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:18,596
You follow me?

511
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,952
Layered,

512
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,654
like nachos.
Exponential growth.

513
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:24,516
Now that's success,

514
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:26,548
with a capital "S".

515
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,002
Straight up.

516
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:30,802
- For shizzle.
- Friggin' awesome.

517
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:44,020
We're set.

518
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:47,558
Our boys are ready.
Gonna be some mad cheddar.

519
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:52,649
Cheddar, Mr. White.
Fat stacks, dead presidents.

520
00:40:52,903 --> 00:40:53,953
Cash money.

521
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,038
We're going to own this city.

522
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,290
We're not charging enough.

523
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:02,876
What?

524
00:41:03,813 --> 00:41:06,254
Corner the market,
then raise the price.

525
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:08,631
Simple economics.

526
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,071
Come on in.

527
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:35,117
- Looks like they got you all set up.
- Yeah. It's perfect.

528
00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:38,414
I am close enough to the bathroom
not to waddle too far,

529
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:39,810
and that's very nice.

530
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:42,040
I figured that might
be a deal-breaker.

531
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:44,918
Listen, I...

532
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:49,131
I wanted to thank you
for having me back.

533
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:52,175
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

534
00:41:57,497 --> 00:41:59,516
It's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

535
00:42:00,046 --> 00:42:03,854
Damn. It's grape juice. I've been making
the girls breakfast in the morning.

536
00:42:04,312 --> 00:42:05,564
How's Denise doing?

537
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:08,525
We split up about a year ago.

538
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:11,816
I'm sorry.

539
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:15,848
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am, too, most days.

540
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:17,823
Together since high school.

541
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,999
I remember that.

542
00:42:20,124 --> 00:42:21,124
Anyway...

543
00:42:21,827 --> 00:42:23,777
I don't know. People change.

544
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,014
I just wanted to welcome you...

545
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:29,843
welcome you back.

546
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:33,467
I'll see you around
the vending machines.

547
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,327
We should have lunch one day.
Like old times.

548
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,347
Sure.

549
00:44:25,813 --> 00:44:26,863
So, listen.

550
00:44:28,437 --> 00:44:30,917
My name's not really Jesse Jackson.

551
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:35,306
It's Jesse Pinkman.

552
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:38,124
And that guy you met,

553
00:44:41,803 --> 00:44:43,223
he's not my dad.

554
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:54,712
You're not going to kick me out,

555
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:56,258
are you?

556
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:59,529
'Cause I actually
really like it here.

557
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:04,085
I don't make it my business
what you do.

558
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:06,832
So long as you don't do it here.

559
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,827
So, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

560
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:22,567
Want to see?

561
00:45:50,977 --> 00:45:53,847
It's got that thing
where the blacks are, like,

562
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:56,496
you know, really,
really, really black,

563
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,276
and the...

564
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,469
Dolby six-point-whatever,

565
00:46:04,675 --> 00:46:06,725
so it'll really rock the house.

566
00:46:08,086 --> 00:46:09,636
But I'll, you know...

567
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:11,806
I'll keep it way down.

568
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:14,666
Of course.

569
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:28,116
I don't know
what the hell's taking so long.

570
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:32,671
Come on.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
