00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:51,023
in critical condition.

187
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:53,023
Your brother-in-law's
one tough son of a bitch

188
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:54,423
to take them both out,

189
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:56,703
considering he didn't
even have his gun.

190
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,663
He didn't have his gun?

191
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:08,943
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

192
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:12,223
Marie, the assault charge.

193
00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:15,423
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

194
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:18,783
That means I had to
take away his weapon.

195
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,143
[muttering]

196
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:21,903
It's standard procedure.
No one--

197
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,263
Okay, All right. Listen.

198
00:11:23,303 --> 00:11:25,183
If you would have all
listened to him

199
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:26,343
right from the start,

200
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:28,263
and let him arrest
that little degenerate,

201
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:31,143
he wouldn't have had to take
things into his own hands,

202
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:33,423
and he would have had a gun
and defended himself.

203
00:11:33,463 --> 00:11:34,583
Marie,
let's just--

204
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:35,623
No. Just--

205
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,663
It's their fault.

206
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:42,183
He didn't have a gun.

207
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:44,303
Honey, this isn't helping you.

208
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:46,143
You.

209
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:48,743
What kind of partner are you?

210
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:52,583
You were supposed
to back him up,

211
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:54,023
and where were you?

212
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,063
Where were you?

213
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:57,783
Texas.

214
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,463
And you.

215
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:04,823
You're supposed to
protect your agents

216
00:12:04,863 --> 00:12:07,183
instead of taking their guns,

217
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:08,623
not supporting them,

218
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:10,023
not backing them up--

219
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,703
Marie. Marie.
...when they--

220
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:16,743
Honey, let's just go
and sit down, okay?

221
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:18,143
I'm not doing anything

222
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:20,343
until these two get
the hell out of here.

223
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:21,503
I mean it.

224
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:28,863
Sorry--
Go.

225
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:31,143
You are not welcome here.

226
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,023
The DEA is not welcome here.

227
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:35,423
Honey.

228
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,823
Come on.

229
00:12:36,863 --> 00:12:38,743
Come on. Let's go sit down.

230
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:53,423
It's not just them.

231
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:57,503
It's you, Walt.

232
00:13:03,943 --> 00:13:08,943
This Pinkman that Hank
was looking for--

233
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:12,063
Hank would have never
even heard his name

234
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:15,903
if you hadn't bought
marijuana from him.

235
00:13:15,943 --> 00:13:16,983
Marie--

236
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:19,103
Do you ever think
about that, Walt?

237
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:20,983
Do you?

238
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,303
Do you ever think
about everything

239
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:24,783
that you have put him through?

240
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,063
[Skyler] Marie, stop.

241
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:28,663
You're upset,

242
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,063
and you're looking
for someone to blame,

243
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:32,703
and it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

244
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:34,783
It's not his fault.

245
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:43,503
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:45,063
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:46,743
Sweetheart. No.
No. No. Don't--

248
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:48,583
[sobbing]

249
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:52,823
It's okay.

250
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:54,943
It's Hank--

251
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:57,183
It's all right.

252
00:13:57,223 --> 00:13:58,343
Shh.

253
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:00,343
[sobbing]

254
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,143
All right, you're done.

255
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:18,463
Okay, next.

256
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:53,943
Hello!

257
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:59,783
[imitating echo] Hello,
hello, hello, hello, hello.

258
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:06,783
Yeah.

259
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:07,943
Wow.

260
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:10,503
[grunt]

261
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:17,583
Yo, yo, yo!

262
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:20,063
Jesse Pinkman in the house!

263
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:27,503
Oh, my dear God.

264
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:36,703
[laughs]

265
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:41,063
Wow.

266
00:17:02,343 --> 00:17:03,663
[beep]

267
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:06,263
Walter White to the nearest
courtesy phone.

268
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,583
Walter White, please
pick up a courtesy phone.

269
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:24,663
[Jesse] Yo.
We working sometime this year?

270
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:26,263
What the hell
are you thinking?

271
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:28,303
Why are you calling me here?

272
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:30,783
I tried your cell, and it
went straight to voice mail.

273
00:17:30,823 --> 00:17:32,663
How else am I supposed
to get hold of you?

274
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:33,823
You aren't.

275
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:35,543
Look, man,
it's been a whole day.

276
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,823
How long is this
grieving process?

277
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:38,663
Just put a clock on it for me.

278
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:41,943
All's I'm saying is
we have a schedule, right?

279
00:17:41,983 --> 00:17:44,423
My family comes
before your schedule.

280
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,663
Dude, it's not
my schedule.

281
00:17:46,703 --> 00:17:48,623
We have responsibilities here.

282
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:51,383
I'll get there
when I get there.

283
00:17:51,423 --> 00:17:53,823
You know what? Whatever.

284
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:55,383
I'll just cook on my own.

285
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:56,823
You will do no such thing.

286
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:57,863
Why not?

287
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:01,263
Well, uh, for starters,

288
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:03,303
you aren't
the least bit familiar

289
00:18:03,303 --> 00:18:04,583
with any of the equipment.

290
00:18:04,623 --> 00:18:07,023
There's got to be some
sort of manual, right?

291
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:08,223
And I can read.

292
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:10,063
Jesse, touch nothing.

293
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:12,503
Yo, stop treating me
I'm like your assistant.

294
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:14,223
I'm not your bitch
to order around.

295
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:15,463
We're partners.

296
00:18:15,503 --> 00:18:16,783
Remember?

297
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:19,983
I need you to sit patiently

298
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:22,903
and wait, and I will be there
as soon as I can.

299
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:25,063
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

300
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:27,063
We-- We really do
appreciate that.

301
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:28,743
What, is your wife there?

302
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:31,023
Uh, yes. Yes, she is,

303
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:33,943
and she would be happy to know
that you asked about her.

304
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:35,943
And please do keep us
in your thoughts.

305
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:37,943
Hey, tell your douche-bag
brother-in-law

306
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,463
to head towards the light.

307
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:44,383
So I'm thinking, um,

308
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,423
maybe we should go get
everybody some breakfast.

309
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,303
Yeah. That sounds good.

310
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:50,143
Do you know who that was?

311
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:10,543
You know, these eggs
are really not too bad.

312
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:25,103
Look at that.

313
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:26,463
Look at what?

314
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:29,823
At what? This. These spots.

315
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:32,663
This fork is absolutely filthy.

316
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:38,823
Tell me you see this.

317
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:40,543
You've got good eyes.
Look at that.

318
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,423
Marie, those
are just water spots.

319
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:44,983
Fork is fine.

320
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
Those are not water spots.

321
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:49,943
That's dirt.

322
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:53,623
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

323
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:56,903
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

324
00:19:56,943 --> 00:19:58,943
God knows what.

325
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:03,343
Seriously, Aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

326
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:06,583
Ours at home aren't any better.

327
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,383
Yours at home are irrelevant.

328
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:09,903
We're in a hospital.

329
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,023
They need to be held
to a higher standard.

330
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:13,303
They have a responsibility.

331
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:15,143
Well, I'm not actually sure

332
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:17,743
if the cafeteria
necessarily qualifies

333
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,063
as being part of a hospital.

334
00:20:19,103 --> 00:20:20,903
It's in the same building.

335
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:22,263
It's all under the same roof.

336
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,743
Do you think that sick
people aren't eating

337
00:20:24,783 --> 00:20:26,943
with this bacteria-infected
silverware?

338
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:29,783
My Gpd, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

339
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,303
[Skyler] Marie.

340
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:39,263
I survived.

341
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:43,343
I had my lumpectomy
at this hospital.

342
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:44,543
Remember that?

343
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:48,143
Remember how scared
we all were?

344
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,303
Whoo.

345
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:51,423
I didn't want to act like it,

346
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:54,943
but I was terrified.

347
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,943
All that week,
all I could think of

348
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,783
was how they were actually
going to cut me open

349
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:06,503
and take out a part of me

350
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:09,303
that was with me
my entire life.

351
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:11,703
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

352
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:16,063
I think the scariest part

353
00:21:16,063 --> 00:21:18,143
was when...

354
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:20,543
They took me into pre-op,

355
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,623
lying there,

356
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:26,063
waiting for them
to anesthetize you,

357
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:29,103
knowing that...

358
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:30,943
You may never wake up again.

359
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:39,583
[chuckles] Actually,

360
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:42,623
what I really remember
about that day

361
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:45,183
is driving to the hospital.

362
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:48,263
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

363
00:21:48,303 --> 00:21:50,463
Yeah.

364
00:21:50,503 --> 00:21:54,623
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central,

365
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:57,983
and we hit every green light--

366
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:00,703
I mean, every single light
that we hit--

00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:28,343
Yeah, I--
I skimmed through it.

550
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:29,703
Looks interesting.

551
00:33:29,743 --> 00:33:30,903
Yeah.

552
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:34,263
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

553
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,823
What's it about?

554
00:33:42,023 --> 00:33:44,383
Pablo Escobar,

555
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:46,903
this big drug guy in the '80s.

556
00:33:48,183 --> 00:33:51,103
Yeah. Yeah, I remember
seeing him on the news.

557
00:33:51,143 --> 00:33:56,303
Well, it's more about
the guys who investigated him

558
00:33:56,343 --> 00:33:58,983
and tried to bring him down.

559
00:33:59,023 --> 00:34:02,103
Some of them were DEA,
you know?

560
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:07,543
Uncle Hank said that they
were worth learning about,

561
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,823
that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is,

562
00:34:10,863 --> 00:34:13,823
but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

563
00:34:16,143 --> 00:34:18,263
I guess I never thought
about it.

564
00:34:20,423 --> 00:34:21,583
[chuckles]

565
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:25,463
He said that good guys

566
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:27,743
never get ink
like the bad guys do.

567
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:36,823
[chuckles]

568
00:34:36,863 --> 00:34:39,823
So he gave it to me.

569
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:41,823
Figured I'd read it.

570
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:46,703
[cell phone ringing]

571
00:34:56,223 --> 00:34:58,783
Uh, I-- I need to--

572
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:00,743
I'll be right back, okay?

573
00:35:07,383 --> 00:35:10,143
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work.

574
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:12,343
Absolutely.

575
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:16,423
[Gus] So I can expect delivery
by tomorrow as scheduled.

576
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:18,743
Well, uh--

577
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,503
No. Unfortunately--

578
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:24,303
Unfortunately,
we're not going to be able

579
00:35:24,343 --> 00:35:26,543
to keep our schedule this week.

580
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,103
But not for lack of trying.

581
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:31,223
Is there something
I should know?

582
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:36,183
Well, to be completely
honest with you...

583
00:35:36,223 --> 00:35:38,783
Gale really screwed us up.

584
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:40,623
I mean, not on purpose,
of course,

585
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:42,983
but he just--
he set us way back,

586
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:47,023
and we've been playing
catch-up ever since.

587
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:51,023
And I've had to be out
running errands

588
00:35:51,063 --> 00:35:53,863
and trying to keep us
on target.

589
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:56,623
Some of the equipment

590
00:35:56,663 --> 00:35:58,383
wasn't calibrated
correctly and--

591
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:01,623
Well, it's just all
very technical and boring,

592
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:04,863
but rest assured that--

593
00:36:04,903 --> 00:36:07,223
that we will
do whatever it takes.

594
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:09,823
It has my total attention.

595
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:12,063
We'll cook through
the weekend if necessary.

596
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:16,423
We will have 400 pounds
for you by next week.

597
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:22,543
I have your word on that?

598
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:23,863
You do.

599
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:27,543
You have my word on that.

600
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,103
Thank you for the update.

601
00:36:56,543 --> 00:36:58,223
Any news?

602
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:02,143
Nah, I'm just-- just wandering.

603
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:04,183
How's everybody doing?

604
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:07,863
Well, as well
as can be expected.

605
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:11,103
It's this not knowing

606
00:37:11,143 --> 00:37:13,023
that's the hardest part,
I think.

607
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:17,543
Anything new on these guys?

608
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,583
Who they are?
What they wanted?

609
00:37:19,623 --> 00:37:21,783
No, nothing yet,

610
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,783
but we'll get it.

611
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:29,143
Steve...

612
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,343
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

613
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:38,543
Buddy, nobody's getting
to Hank.

614
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:40,983
That was their one shot,
and they blew it.

615
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:42,863
So, no.

616
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:46,343
No way.

617
00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:48,863
Jesus.

618
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,583
I'd love to walk in there

619
00:37:50,623 --> 00:37:52,583
and shoot that bastard
right in the head.

620
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:54,023
Me, too.

621
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,703
[cell phone rings]

622
00:38:02,343 --> 00:38:03,623
Yeah.

623
00:38:04,863 --> 00:38:06,263
Oh, yeah?

624
00:38:06,263 --> 00:38:08,983
Great. We'll be right down.

625
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:10,623
Food's here.

626
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,463
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

627
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:17,383
Uh, on occasion, yeah.

628
00:38:17,423 --> 00:38:19,303
Owner's a big booster
for the DEA.

629
00:38:19,343 --> 00:38:22,543
He heard what happened.
He's going to feed every cop in the building.

630
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:25,783
That's-- That's wonderful.

631
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:28,543
Yeah, and apparently he's
bringing it by personally.

632
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:33,383
[elevator bell dings]

633
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:37,783
[Marie] I don't even
know what to say.

634
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:38,863
[Skyler]
That's an incredible--

635
00:38:38,903 --> 00:38:40,143
Good, huh?

636
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:41,623
Delicious.

637
00:38:41,663 --> 00:38:44,823
[Marie] That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

638
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:46,343
[Skyler] Yes, thank you.

639
00:38:46,383 --> 00:38:47,503
Guys, did you hear that?

640
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:50,183
Mr. Fring is offering
a $10,000 reward

641
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:52,223
on any information
about the case.

642
00:38:52,223 --> 00:38:55,823
Well, that's--
that's wonderful.

643
00:38:55,823 --> 00:38:58,383
Wow. Thank you, Mr. Fring.

644
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,223
You're very welcome.

645
00:39:00,263 --> 00:39:02,263
Men like your husband
are the thin blue line

646
00:39:02,303 --> 00:39:04,423
between us and these animals.

647
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:06,543
I only wish I could do more.

648
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,623
Well, we do appreciate
your support.

649
00:39:13,663 --> 00:39:16,143
This reward could turn
the tide here.

650
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:18,863
It'll really help.

651
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:22,343
Again, I can't express
how sorry I am.

652
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:24,623
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

653
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:26,783
[Marie] Really?

654
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:30,023
Our fun run,
a couple months ago.

655
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:33,423
Mr. Fring
was one of our sponsors.

656
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:37,263
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

657
00:39:37,303 --> 00:39:40,983
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

658
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:46,743
Really? Huh.

659
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:50,303
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you,

660
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:53,143
and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

661
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,583
I hope that there's been
good news.

662
00:39:57,423 --> 00:40:01,463
Uh, yeah, things
have improved, yes.

663
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:03,783
That's wonderful to hear.

664
00:40:03,823 --> 00:40:07,343
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

665
00:40:09,463 --> 00:40:13,543
Well, I've taken up
enough of your time.

666
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:17,943
Um... thank you
again very much.

667
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,463
It was a great pleasure
to meet you.

668
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:21,623
Thank you. 
[Walter, Jr.] Yes, thank you.

669
00:40:23,783 --> 00:40:26,063
Let me walk you out.
Oh-- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

670
00:40:32,743 --> 00:40:36,023
You know,
I didn't say thank you.

671
00:40:36,023 --> 00:40:37,143
I'll walk him out.

672
00:40:37,183 --> 00:40:38,663
I'll be right back.

673
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:43,623
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

674
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:45,303
Enjoying the chicken?

675
00:40:45,303 --> 00:40:47,303
Good. Good-- Hey.

676
00:40:47,343 --> 00:40:49,583
Oh, you're very welcome.
My pleasure.

677
00:40:49,623 --> 00:40:51,223
My pleasure, yeah.
Excuse me.

678
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:52,823
Thank you. Thank you.

679
00:40:52,863 --> 00:40:54,383
It's good chicken, huh?
Yeah.

680
00:40:54,423 --> 00:40:55,703
Good.
Mr. Fring.

681
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:57,263
May I--
Mr. White.

682
00:40:57,303 --> 00:40:59,063
I just wanted
to thank you again.

683
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:00,583
Oh, it's my pleasure.

684
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,943
Uh, may I--
may I speak with you?

685
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:04,303
Just a moment?

686
00:41:09,023 --> 00:41:11,103
You knew.

687
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:13,663
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

688
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:18,063
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

689
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:20,903
What careful man wouldn't?

690
00:41:20,943 --> 00:41:23,863
He is not a problem for us,

691
00:41:23,903 --> 00:41:25,943
for our business.

692
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:32,143
Your being here is--

693
00:41:32,183 --> 00:41:35,743
Is this some sort of message?

694
00:41:35,783 --> 00:41:38,143
I'm supporting my community.

695
00:41:38,183 --> 00:41:40,983
I hide in plain sight,
same as you.

696
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:42,223
Are we done?

697
00:41:42,223 --> 00:41:43,223
No-- No, listen, I--

698
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:44,623
This attack
on my brother-in-law--

699
00:41:44,663 --> 00:41:46,743
I don't--
I don't understand it.

700
00:41:46,783 --> 00:41:48,663
I don't know what it means.

701
00:41:48,663 --> 00:41:52,903
Please, if you have
some knowledge

702
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,503
that you could share with me.

703
00:42:00,023 --> 00:42:02,623
I fear for my family.

704
00:42:02,663 --> 00:42:03,743
I'm sure they'll be fine.

705
00:42:03,783 --> 00:42:06,343
I am told the assassin
that survived

706
00:42:06,383 --> 00:42:07,823
is gravely injured.

707
00:42:07,863 --> 00:42:09,623
It's doubtful he'll live.

708
00:42:13,223 --> 00:42:15,583
Now thank me and shake my hand.

709
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:22,463
Uh-- thank you.
Thank you again.

710
00:42:22,503 --> 00:42:24,503
You're quite welcome,
Mr. White.

711
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:38,183
What's going on?

712
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,983
What's happening?

713
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:41,023
[Woman]
Starting chest compressions.

714
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:42,783
One, two, three, four.

715
00:42:42,783 --> 00:42:44,623
[monitor flatlines]
[alarm beeping]

716
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:45,703
One, two, three--
[Man] Defib?

717
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,223
No reason.
Patient is--

718
00:42:47,263 --> 00:42:49,223
Continuing chest compressions.

719
00:42:49,263 --> 00:42:51,023
One, two, three, four.

720
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:53,383
Give me a liter of saline wide open.
I can't get a pulse back.

721
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:55,063
One, two, three, four.

722
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,623
[Man] Still nothing.
One, two, three--

723
00:42:56,663 --> 00:42:58,623
All right.
Stopping compressions.

724
00:42:58,663 --> 00:42:59,903
Time.

725
00:42:59,903 --> 00:43:01,223
8:43.

726
00:43:01,263 --> 00:43:03,103
Time of death. 20:43.

727
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:05,423
[steadbeep]

728
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:07,543
Burn in hell,
you piece of shit.

729
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:23,983
[sizzling]

730
00:43:25,543 --> 00:43:27,863
[cell phone vibrating]

731
00:43:34,303 --> 00:43:36,063
Yes? Juan?

732
00:43:36,103 --> 00:43:38,143
[Bolsa]
I assume you heard the news.

733
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:41,023
Your man died.
I heard.

734
00:43:41,063 --> 00:43:42,143
It's unfortunate.

735
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:43,543
Yeah, "unfortunate,"

736
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,583
and meanwhile I have Federales
surrounding my house.

737
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:48,943
You know what I think, Gustavo?

738
00:43:48,983 --> 00:43:50,423
I think you're behind all this.

739
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:54,223
Why would I do this?
How would it serve me?

740
00:43:54,263 --> 00:43:56,223
That's the part I'm trying
to figure out.

741
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:59,343
Go off on your own, maybe.

742
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:00,943
Would you actually think
that would work?

743
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:04,023
Juan, you sound like
you're under a lot of stress.

744
00:44:04,063 --> 00:44:05,383
Maybe you should call me back

745
00:44:05,423 --> 00:44:06,863
when you're seeing things
more clearly.

746
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:08,703
I see things clear enough.

747
00:44:08,743 --> 00:44:12,423
One DEA gets shot.
All of Washington starts barking.

748
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:14,623
The D.F. suddenly
has to put on a big show,

749
00:44:14,663 --> 00:44:17,623
and I wind up with Federales
in my rose bushes.

750
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:19,423
But just for a while.

751
00:44:19,463 --> 00:44:23,903
Appearances, politics.

752
00:44:23,943 --> 00:44:25,983
Are you still there,
Gustavo?

753
00:44:26,023 --> 00:44:29,103
Yes, I'm here.

754
00:44:29,143 --> 00:44:31,823
I'll weather this.
I always do.

755
00:44:31,863 --> 00:44:33,703
My brother's a police chief.

756
00:44:33,743 --> 00:44:36,303
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

757
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:38,743
And when I get proof

758
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,143
and the others find out
what you've done,

759
00:44:42,183 --> 00:44:45,023
maybe we come pay you a visit.

760
00:44:45,063 --> 00:44:47,343
Maybe we c--

762
00:44:48,623 --> 00:44:49,943
[Men shouting]

763

00:44:51,263 --> 00:44:52,783

[gunfire]

770
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:36,023
Skyler. Skyler.

771
00:45:36,063 --> 00:45:37,823
Marie. Marie.

772
00:45:39,383 --> 00:45:41,943
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

773
00:45:41,983 --> 00:45:44,943
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

774
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:47,703
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it's immediately family only.

775
00:45:47,743 --> 00:45:48,983
We're all family.

776
00:45:49,023 --> 00:45:50,303
I understand,

777
00:45:50,303 --> 00:45:52,623
but we have a certain protocol
here that we need--

778
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:55,263
We're all family.

779
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:07,303
