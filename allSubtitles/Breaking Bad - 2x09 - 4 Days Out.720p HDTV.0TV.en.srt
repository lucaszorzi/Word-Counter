1
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,593
These people.

2
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:28,819
Pathetic.

3
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:32,958
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,159
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,621
You know, you guys really
don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:41,308
We won't even get
the results till next week.

7
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:44,179
Buddy, we're going to be here.
You kidding me?

8
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:46,919
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

9
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:51,082
You definitely want the PET/CT
and not just the PET.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,505
It's a PET/CT.

11
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:57,268
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:57,947 --> 00:00:59,369
Some places skimp,

13
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:01,143
and they only do the PET.

14
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:03,938
I'm not naming any names, but...

15
00:01:05,326 --> 00:01:08,482
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

16
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:10,405
This is where Walt's doctor is.

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,514
With us, you wouldn't have to wait
until next week to get the results.

18
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:18,626
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

19
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:22,631
I could take one look at Walt's
and tell you immediately how he's doing.

20
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:23,624
Really.

21
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,670
Doctors like people to think
that they're so much smarter

22
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:30,798
than the technicians,
but you would be surprised

23
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:33,634
how much they come to us for input.

24
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:41,183
Never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

25
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:42,761
Excuse me.

26
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:56,396
You all right in there?

27
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:04,298
You okay?

28
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:10,446
I'm fine, thank you.

29
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,513
Sir, you can go back to
your changing room and get dressed.

30
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:41,130
So, how'd we do?

31
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,062
You did fine.

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,075
- See anything?
- I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,190
Dr. Delcavoli will go over
the results with you next week.

34
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:53,191
Sorry.

35
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,110
Synch: Tyno, Michvanilly

36
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,247
www.forom.com
www.sub-way.fr

37
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:35,548
Actually, the money laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

38
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:39,234
But I gotta tell ya,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect...

39
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:42,194
Most people want to know
why they suddenly got rich.

40
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:45,515
If she finds out,
it's after I'm gone.

41
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:48,634
How much time they giving you?

42
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:50,428
Weeks.

43
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,232
Maybe.

44
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,500
Sorry to hear it.

45
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:58,487
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

46
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:01,624
Oh, well.
Let's crunch some numbers.

47
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:03,899
How much money are we laundering?

48
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:08,596
At this time, $16,000.

49
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,620
How long have you been doing this?

50
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:15,826
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

51
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:17,234
Apparently.

52
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,477
All right, 16,000

53
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:22,534
laundered at 75 cents on the dollar,

54
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:24,303
minus my fee,

55
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,524
which is 17%,

56
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:30,839
comes to $9,960.
Congratulations.

57
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:33,813
You just left your family
a secondhand Subaru.

58
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:37,550
We'll just have
to cook more, a lot more.

59
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,152
That's my legal opinion.

60
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:43,193
Make hay while the sun
is still shining.

61
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,682
You know, we should
do something this weekend.

62
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:56,038
Get our minds off the test results?

63
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:00,392
Actually, I...

64
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,035
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

65
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:12,923
Really?

66
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:16,701
You know, I never did call her.

67
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:21,693
You're expecting the...

68
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:24,291
the news from the scan to be bad.

69
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:30,775
God.

70
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:35,624
I need you to stay
positive with me here.

71
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,830
I am.

72
00:05:37,322 --> 00:05:38,812
Positive is good.

73
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:43,398
I'm all for positive,
but positive doesn't change facts.

74
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:44,928
All right?

75
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:50,073
It doesn't change
the need to be prepared.

76
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:51,122
I know.

77
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:54,645
I'm just trying to be hopeful, okay?

78
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,938
You know? Forgive me.

79
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:00,959
Look,

80
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:05,013
I need to know Mom's going
to leave you something if...

81
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:08,941
if I'm no longer around.

82
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:13,018
I just need to get that straight.
That's all.

83
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,542
And believe me, I'm going
to earn every penny of it, too.

84
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:24,262
Complaining about
her nurses the entire time.

85
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:29,046
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

86
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:34,171
A 30-minute discourse about

87
00:06:35,116 --> 00:06:38,513
how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

88
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:41,788
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them. You know?

89
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:47,773
I'll be lucky if I get
a word in edgewise.

90
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:07,076
I actually think the news from the scan
is going to be good.

91
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:11,361
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

92
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:25,688
We should do something.

93
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:27,357
Yeah, we should.

94
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:29,793
No, something else.

95
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:33,365
We should go somewhere.

96
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:36,869
Have you been to
the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

97
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:39,106
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

98
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:43,048
Georgia O'Keeffe.

99
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,514
She's a painter.

100
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:49,119
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

101
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:50,287
Who is it?

102
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:52,990
Boy, you need some educating.

103
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,127
Yes, I do.
Come here.

104
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:59,132
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

105
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:02,469
You want to go all the way
to Santa Fe for a museum?

106
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:07,710
Yep, we're going.
Get up.

107
00:08:09,412 --> 00:08:13,383
Why can't we just go
to the movies or putt-putt?

108
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:15,253
It's the shit.

109
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,330
A little culture won't kill you.

110
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,292
Besides, you might like it.

111
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:23,029
A lot of her paintings
look like vaginas.

112
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,532
Really?

113
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:30,038
Is there still cereal?

114
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,786
<i>If I know you, leave a message.</i>

115
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,986
<i>Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.</i>

116
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,228
- <i>Hello, Jesse. Pick up...</i>
- Hold on, hold on.

117
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:49,036
Sorry. One sec.

118
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:55,705
What?

119
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:58,776
I've been trying to reach you.
Where's your drop phone?

120
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:03,667
- I've been busy.
- <i>Clear your social calendar.</i>

121
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,421
- We have to cook.
- <i>What? Today?</i>

122
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,048
<i>No. You'll need today
at least to gather supplies.</i>

123
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:13,719
<i>Now, we're going to need all
new glassware, heating mantles,</i>

124
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,055
about a hundred pounds of ice.
Do you have a paper and pencil?

125
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,139
- <i>You should be writing this down.</i>
- Go shopping yourself. I got plans.

126
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:25,566
<i>Smoking marijuana, eating Cheetos,
and masturbating do not constitute</i>

127
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,416
- plans in my book.
- <i>Screw you and your book, man.</i>

128
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,853
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

129
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:34,790
You're going to a museum?

130
00:09:35,638 --> 00:09:37,034
Georgia O'Keeffe.

131
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:40,272
<i>She's a painter? Duh?</i>

132
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,974
She does these vagina pictures.

133
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,501
Or paintings, or...

134
00:09:43,635 --> 00:09:45,292
Or just painted. I don't know.

135
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:49,620
- What are you even talking about?
- Why am I explaining myself to you?

136
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,656
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing. All you need to know is

137
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,753
- <i>I ain't cooking, shopping or whatever.</i>
- Let me explain something to you.

138
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,058
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

139
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,123
Tuesday?
Four days straight?

140
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:05,646
Like it or not, we have no choice.

141
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,123
<i>And why, exactly, is that?</i>

142
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,140
Our methylamine.
It's going bad.

143
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,742
- What?
- <i>It's losing its chemical potency.</i>

144
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:18,450
<i>Now, unless stealing
another barrel sounds</i>

145
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,452
- good to you...
- <i>Hell, no.</i>

146
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:23,288
We have to act fast
before it goes to waste.

147
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:25,469
<i>You have a paper and pencil?</i>

148
00:10:27,198 --> 00:10:30,963
- <i>Come on.</i>
- All right, all right. Go.

149
00:10:36,797 --> 00:10:40,509
- I wish you didn't have to do this.
- Me, too.

150
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:43,976
But I'll be back before you know it,

151
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:46,342
and you can always
call if you need me.

152
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:48,720
And risk talking to your mother?

153
00:10:48,845 --> 00:10:50,995
That'd have to be some emergency.

154
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,495
Love you.

155
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:06,394
Fly safe, okay?

156
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,254
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

157
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:09,591
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

158
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,875
Did you get everything?
All six?

159
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,103
With reflux condensers?

160
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:15,763
Yes, like I said.

161
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:18,503
Just go.
Drive. Go, go.

162
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,256
Good morning to you, too, man.

163
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,349
- Stupid...
- Three entire bags of Funyuns?

164
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:26,967
What?
Funyuns are awesome.

165
00:13:27,678 --> 00:13:29,495
- God.
- More for me.

166
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:32,712
How about something
with some protein, maybe?

167
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:34,636
Something green, huh?

168
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:38,980
Man, I'm getting no service.

169
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:42,827
How are you even alive?

170
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,291
Yo, check your phone.

171
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:47,881
You get any bars?

172
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:49,653
I've got a signal.

173
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:55,327
Let me use yours, would ya?

174
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,784
Absolutely not.

175
00:13:57,031 --> 00:14:00,105
I have to assume Skyler checks
my phone records. You know that.

176
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,984
- It's not business. It's personal.
- Oh, personal.

177
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,164
- What, female?
- Maybe.

178
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:08,168
Absolutely, that's all I need.

179
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:10,778
Skyler hits "redial"
and some stripper answers.

180
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:14,069
Look, she's not a stripper.
Okay, dickwad?

181
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:15,802
Sorry.

182
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,396
My wife checks.

183
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,691
Drinking water?

184
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:23,403
Is that all we've got?

185
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:24,745
Ten gallons?

186
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:27,574
What, you planning
on taking a bath in it?

187
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:34,620
Oh, God.

188
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:44,486
Not there.
That is our work station.

189
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,977
- Our work station.
- That's right.

190
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:52,424
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

191
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,573
Considering this is our only set

192
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:57,257
and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

193
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,400
Why don't you try sticking them
up your ass sideways?

194
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,160
2.35 pounds.

195
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:12,089
2.35.

196
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:14,532
That's the last of it.

197
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:18,279
How many total?

198
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:19,736
19.

199
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,074
Dollar-wise?

200
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:24,973
How much?

201
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,125
Well, median weight...
2.2 pounds.

202
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,598
That's 41.8,

203
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:35,536
call it 42 pounds at...
What are we selling it for these days?

204
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:37,389
- 40 a pound.
- $40,000?

205
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:39,453
You said raise the prices.

206
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:42,477
All right, that's 40 times 42,

207
00:17:42,717 --> 00:17:44,942
minus distribution charges.

208
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:48,690
What?

209
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,424
What?

210
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:55,099
$672,000.

211
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:56,224
All that?

212
00:17:59,062 --> 00:17:59,911
Each.

213
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,169
Each?

214
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:04,374
Each.

215
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,209
Six hundred and...

216
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,357
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

217
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:12,399
Hell, yeah!

218
00:18:12,766 --> 00:18:14,893
Come high, baby!
Come on!

219
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,739
Well, there goes the generator.

220
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,330
I think that's it for the gas.

221
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:32,358
Perfect timing, yo.

222
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,746
- How do you figure that?
- What do you mean? We're done cooking.

223
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:39,626
I am not done until
this barrel is empty.

224
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:41,113
Look at that.

225
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:44,882
I'd say we still got
10, 12 gallons of methylamine.

226
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:48,207
- Come on, where's your ambition?
- Jesus. Seriously?

227
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:50,086
We are way ahead of schedule.

228
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,673
Plus, the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane,

229
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,013
and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

230
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:59,554
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off.

231
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,371
Look, I don't have to take
you back till Tuesday, right?

232
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:06,446
So we come back tomorrow, strap on
the sizzle and glass up the rest.

233
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:07,818
Come on!

234
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:10,893
There's got to be a Denny's
out there someplace.

235
00:19:11,194 --> 00:19:12,244
Grand Slam?

236
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,490
A hot shower?

237
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:16,401
A bed?

238
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:22,474
Separate rooms.

239
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,788
That's a given.

240
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,049
The battery's dead.

241
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,261
Back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place,

242
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,474
- where did you put them?
- I left 'em right here in the ignition.

243
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:47,115
Son of a bitch.

244
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,522
This is not my fault.
The buzzer didn't buzz.

245
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,232
- The what?
- The buzzer.

246
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,443
It buzzes when you put the keys in
to let you know that the battery's on.

247
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,511
I know that. It didn't buzz.

248
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,824
Look, I didn't turn the key or anything.
I'm not stupid.

249
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,867
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

250
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:05,829
It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

251
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,210
Is this a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

252
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:10,875
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

253
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,546
The buzzer did not buzz, and you made me
move the keys in the first place,

254
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,569
- remember?
- I see your point.

255
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:19,634
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should have known to say,

256
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:22,554
"Don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days!"

257
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,348
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch!

258
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:27,892
Oh, I'm sorry.
The work station.

259
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:37,576
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

260
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:41,028
How?

261
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,099
You going to be okay?

262
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:54,331
Damn it.

263
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:58,416
What's it taste like?

264
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:00,034
Bad, huh?

265
00:21:07,411 --> 00:21:09,161
This is good. Right here.

266
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,215
There.

267
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,297
Here. Red to red, black to black.

268
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,740
Positive, negative.

269
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,558
All right. Start it up.

270
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:32,097
The hell's wrong with this thing?

271
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,960
You have to really pull.

272
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:34,897
I am.

273
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,295
Really pull.
Not like a girl.

274
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,214
You know what?
Pull this. I am pulling.

275
00:21:40,783 --> 00:21:42,983
It just needs to warm up a little.

276
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,724
Oh, Jesus.

277
00:22:14,758 --> 00:22:15,758
Well done.

278
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,900
As always. Just...

279
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:20,773
Well done.

280
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:23,897
God.

281
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:45,881
Come on, you bitches.

282
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,259
Hear me now.

283
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:51,781
Damn it!

284
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,586
This is stupid.

285
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:08,115
Okay, now we have to use your phone.

286
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,773
This is ruined.
Do you understand? Just ruined.

287
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:13,516
I understand you hooked it
up wrong and you blew it up.

288
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,874
- That is not what happened.
- How do you know?

289
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:21,042
I wasn't the one who dumped out the last
of our water. That's what I know.

290
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:24,363
There was a fire.
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

291
00:23:24,894 --> 00:23:28,547
Is that... You were thinking.
Now that we have identified the problem.

292
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,144
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

293
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:35,252
Look, somebody is going
to have to pick us up.

294
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,517
Your wife is not going
to notice one little call.

295
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:41,918
Mr. White, come on.

296
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:45,746
All right, look.

297
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,912
Make it snappy.

298
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,478
- The roaming drains the battery.
- All right.

299
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,769
Yo, Skinny, hey.

300
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,105
Listen, I need you
to come pick us up.

301
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,505
Now, all right?
We're stuck out here.

302
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,580
You got a pen for directions?

303
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,862
A pencil's fine, retard.

304
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,531
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

305
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,283
All right, so you ready?

306
00:24:12,408 --> 00:24:16,406
So you're going to head west on the 40
for, like, what, 30 miles?

307
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,568
And you're just gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

308
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:25,588
Big arrows, giant arrows. They light up
and blink and shit. You can't miss them.

309
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,591
But then you're gonna want
to take it slow because there's this

310
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,136
dirt road right before this white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

311
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:35,387
Now, you're going to be way,
way out in the boonies, okay?

312
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:39,503
Like, crazy far, so you just got to keep
heading down that dirt road for what?

313
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,417
About another 15 miles.

314
00:24:41,763 --> 00:24:43,113
Really? That far?

315
00:24:43,383 --> 00:24:44,934
Hurry up. The battery.

316
00:24:45,185 --> 00:24:47,777
Just go down that road
for, like, 15 more miles.

317
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,786
I mean, we're way the hell out here.

318
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,115
And yo, listen.

319
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:54,476
Bring water.

320
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,536
Leave now.

321
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,676
Here.

322
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:00,658
He's coming.

323
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,924
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel

324
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,410
who broke his leg mountain biking,

325
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:14,970
and he had to drink urine for,

326
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:18,583
you know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

327
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:21,042
He said it tasted like really hot,

328
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,917
really old soda.

329
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,667
We should just call.

330
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:32,578
You know? I'll be quick.
Just be like,

331
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:34,225
"Yo, where are you?"

332
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:38,085
All right.

333
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:50,086
Come on.

334
00:25:52,506 --> 00:25:54,195
Yo, where are you?

335
00:25:55,736 --> 00:25:57,305
So you saw the white sign?

336
00:25:58,226 --> 00:25:59,576
He's almost here.

337
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,392
Oh, man.

338
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:03,774
We're getting really freaked out.

339
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:06,857
All right,
so you're on the dirt road?

340
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,900
He's on the dirt road. Good.

341
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:11,099
You just crossed the river?

342
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:14,488
- Have you seen anything?
- Wait, wait. What river?

343
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:19,827
What river? What the hell river you
talking about, man? There's no river.

344
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:22,246
Can you...

345
00:26:24,613 --> 00:26:25,763
Phone's dead.

346
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:31,957
Now what?

347
00:26:37,144 --> 00:26:38,144
What now?

348
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,525
Come on.
Seriously?

349
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:18,077
What's this?

350
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,356
I'm trying to

351
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,366
trickle-charge the battery.

352
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:27,959
Seriously?

353
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:30,999
Just by turning that thing?

354
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,608
The commutator.

355
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,320
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

356
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:38,990
Usually, this little

357
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:41,492
piston engine turns it,

358
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:45,788
but considering it's lying here
completely totaled...

359
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:51,343
Anyway.

360
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:56,796
Apply a little elbow grease...

361
00:27:57,836 --> 00:27:59,236
It'll take longer.

362
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,953
A lot longer.

363
00:28:02,226 --> 00:28:04,807
But theoretically,

364
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:07,196
it should work.

365
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:10,761
Theoretically.

366
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:17,783
It has to work.

367
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:20,269
You understand?

368
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:31,483
Can I try?

369
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,862
How much longer?

370
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:18,636
I don't know.

371
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:03,048
You hanging in?

372
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
I'm good.

373
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,603
It's got to be ready by now. Right?

374
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:16,981
Give it a little longer,

375
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:19,901
just to make sure we're...

376
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:38,232
Methylamine doesn't spoil, does it?

377
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,342
That's not why we're here.

378
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:00,956
Lie much?

379
00:31:09,463 --> 00:31:10,276
Push.

380
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:33,931
Come on.

381
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:39,464
Please.

382
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:08,568
God.

383
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:12,176
Please.

384
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:34,077
Why couldn't I have
just gone to Santa Fe?

385
00:32:34,821 --> 00:32:35,622
Why?

386
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,161
What are you doing?

387
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,360
I had this coming.

388
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,561
What?

389
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,360
I have it coming.

390
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:32,323
I deserve this.

391
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:35,306
You snap out of it.

392
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:39,191
First off, everything
you did, you did for your family.

393
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:40,797
Right?

394
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:45,522
All I ever managed to do

395
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,022
was worry and disappoint them

396
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:51,584
and lie.

397
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:54,956
God.

398
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:57,323
All the lies.

399
00:33:59,722 --> 00:34:01,144
I can't even...

400
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:05,125
I can't even keep them
straight in my head anymore.

401
00:34:06,357 --> 00:34:07,519
You know what?

402
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:09,994
Screw this. I'm walking.

403
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,467
You can come or not.

404
00:34:14,665 --> 00:34:16,473
Where's my other shoe?

405
00:34:25,003 --> 00:34:26,149
Your body

406
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:30,014
is running dangerously
low on electrolytes.

407
00:34:32,665 --> 00:34:35,197
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

408
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,226
And when they're gone,

409
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,827
your brain ceases
to communicate with your muscles.

410
00:34:43,674 --> 00:34:45,808
Your lungs stop breathing,

411
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:48,568
your heart stops pumping.

412
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:52,686
You go marching out there,

413
00:34:53,596 --> 00:34:55,046
and within an hour,

414
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,226
you will be dead.

415
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:01,969
You need to cut out
all your loser cry-baby crap right now

416
00:35:02,094 --> 00:35:04,294
and think of something scientific!

417
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:07,195
Something scientific, right.

418
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:08,853
What? Come on.

419
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:10,354
You're smart.

420
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:13,357
You made poison out of beans.

421
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:15,602
All right, look.

422
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:20,904
We got an entire lab right here.

423
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:23,367
All right?
How about you

424
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:27,166
take some of these chemicals
and mix up some rocket fuel?

425
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:30,294
That way,
you can just send up a signal flare.

426
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,213
Or you make some kind of robot

427
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:36,363
to get us help,
or a homing device or...

428
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:39,083
build a new battery or...

429
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,380
Wait. No.

430
00:35:41,132 --> 00:35:43,932
What if we just
take some stuff off of the RV

431
00:35:44,264 --> 00:35:47,240
and build it into something
completely different?

432
00:35:47,365 --> 00:35:49,861
Like a dune buggy.

433
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:53,079
That way, we can just dune buggy...

434
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:58,491
What is it?

435
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:00,925
What?

436
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:04,583
Do you have any money?

437
00:36:05,587 --> 00:36:08,705
- Change, I mean. Coins.
- I got a bunch of them.

438
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,133
Then gather them.

439
00:36:12,258 --> 00:36:15,876
And washers and nuts
and bolts and screws

440
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:19,422
and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

441
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:23,096
It has to be galvanized
or solid zinc.

442
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,823
- Solid zinc, right.
- And bring me

443
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,521
brake pads.
The front wheels should have discs.

444
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,503
Take them off and bring them to me.

445
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,495
Brake pads.

446
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,241
- What are we building?
- You said it yourself.

447
00:36:43,154 --> 00:36:44,054
A robot?

448
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:46,315
A battery.

449
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:47,707
Move!

450
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:03,446
This doesn't look like
any battery I ever saw.

451
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:06,390
Well, trust me. It is a battery.

452
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:09,552
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

453
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:14,210
Here.
Cut up the last two sponges.

454
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,347
Remember the electrolytes?

455
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:18,883
Think about it.

456
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,424
A battery is a galvanic cell.

457
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:25,619
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode

458
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:28,058
separated by an electrolyte, right?

459
00:37:29,061 --> 00:37:30,861
- Right.
- Well, anyway.

460
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:34,562
On one side, we have mercuric oxide

461
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,129
and graphite from your brake pads.

462
00:37:37,473 --> 00:37:39,304
This is the cathode.

463
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:41,557
This is the positive terminal.

464
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:45,426
This is where the supply
of current flows out from.

465
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,539
You see?

466
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:47,697
Then...

467
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:51,548
Here, I'll show you.
On the opposite side is our anode.

468
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,077
This...

469
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:55,986
It's zinc.

470
00:37:56,733 --> 00:38:00,717
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

471
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:05,122
So, the sponge is the electrolyte?

472
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:09,475
No, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

473
00:38:09,844 --> 00:38:12,937
But yes,
that's what I'm soaking the sponges in.

474
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,863
Good.

475
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,849
Good.
And now,

476
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,100
what shall we use

477
00:38:22,385 --> 00:38:25,049
to conduct
this beautiful current with?

478
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:28,084
What one particular element

479
00:38:28,493 --> 00:38:29,930
comes to mind?

480
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:37,351
A wire.

481
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:41,393
Copper.

482
00:38:42,301 --> 00:38:44,451
- Well, I mean...
- It's copper.

483
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,905
The only question now is

484
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:50,908
will this supply enough current?

485
00:38:51,352 --> 00:38:53,790
And how many cells will we need?

486
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:57,152
Maybe we've only got
material enough for six.

487
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:08,939
Put the lid on.
Wait.

488
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:10,277
Positive.

489
00:39:14,222 --> 00:39:15,122
Cathode.

490
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:21,927
Anode.

491
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:23,867
Damn.

492
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:25,554
That is good.

493
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:28,407
That's very good.
Here we go.

494
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:43,645
How's the...

495
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:47,484
It's fine.

496
00:40:59,244 --> 00:41:01,275
I know I can trust you to...

497
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,436
Whatever happens,

498
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:12,742
your family will get your share.

499
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:27,482
So...

500
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,490
I'll be hearing from you.

501
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,733
How's everyone doing?

502
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:06,970
Is that baby ever going
to come out, you think?

503
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:12,126
- I know, enough already. It's...
- I'm teasing.

504
00:42:12,595 --> 00:42:14,245
Everything in its time.

505
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,742
Walt, I have your scan results.

506
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:23,343
And you're showing signs
of remission.

507
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:28,438
My God.

508
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:29,993
I want to clarify.

509
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,966
There are some misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

510
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:35,499
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

511
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:38,096
To classify someone as in remission,

512
00:42:38,221 --> 00:42:40,962
we only need to determine
that the tumor hasn't grown.

513
00:42:41,087 --> 00:42:43,268
That it hasn't grown?
Jesus.

514
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:45,282
Technically speaking,

515
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:48,530
a tumor can remain the exact
same size it was before

516
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:51,171
and the patient
could still be in remission.

517
00:42:51,296 --> 00:42:54,739
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage 3 adenocarcinoma,

518
00:42:55,024 --> 00:42:57,907
I like to see...
I hope to see at least

519
00:42:58,032 --> 00:43:00,876
a 25 to 35% reduction in tumor mass,

520
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:05,133
something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

521
00:43:06,832 --> 00:43:08,498
Everybody still with me?

522
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:12,906
And how has my cancer responded?

523
00:43:14,973 --> 00:43:17,207
Your tumor has shrunk by 80%.

524
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:26,016
- My God.
- Wait, I'm sorry. I'm really...

525
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:30,053
I'm confused. Isn't 80% a lot?

526
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:31,973
Mom.

527
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,320
80% is a lot.

528
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:38,921
- Okay, but, I'm...
- Sweetheart, you were right.

529
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:41,846
- It's very good news.
- It's very good news.

530
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,718
Are you kidding me?

531
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:48,618
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

532
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:04,645
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

533
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:08,798
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

534
00:44:09,128 --> 00:44:12,023
It's okay.
This is fairly common.

535
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:15,245
See that scary-looking thing there?

536
00:44:15,493 --> 00:44:18,635
That's tissue inflammation.
That's a reaction to your radio therapy.

537
00:44:19,296 --> 00:44:22,306
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

538
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:24,481
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

539
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,642
Tissue inflammation?

540
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,708
Are you sure about that?

541
00:44:30,188 --> 00:44:32,112
Because the other day,

542
00:44:33,144 --> 00:44:35,094
I was coughing up some blood.

543
00:44:37,153 --> 00:44:38,896
- What?
- You probably have a tear

544
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:41,958
in your esophagus from the coughing,
and that can be very serious.

545
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:44,303
You could rupture
and bleed to death.

546
00:44:44,428 --> 00:44:47,438
We're going to have to deal with that
before you leave here today.

547
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,395
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

548
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:53,330
- I'm sorry. I...
- No more secrets, Walt.

549
00:44:53,455 --> 00:44:56,955
With something like this,
you have to call me. Immediately.

550
00:44:58,576 --> 00:45:01,596
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

551
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:03,613
But now at least
we have some options.

552
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,290
The most important of which is time.

553
00:45:08,045 --> 00:45:10,754
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

554
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,157
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.
