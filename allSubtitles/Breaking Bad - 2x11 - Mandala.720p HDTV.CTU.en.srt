<i>Previously on</i> Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,547
It's an entire city full of buyers.
Now why aren't we exploiting that?

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:07,181
It's not our territory.

4
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:09,092
They're not gonna do
a thing about it.

5
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:11,633
Your tumor has shrunk by 80%.

6
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:13,747
- What's this?
- I'm in recovery.

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:17,117
You know, pot is, like,
stepping stones.

8
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,004
How do you want to proceed?

9
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:20,645
Sell off what we have.

10
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:22,890
Then I guess I'm done.

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,570
Nothing's really changed.

12
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,827
We sell when we want, where we want.

13
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,433
This is our city.

14
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:30,215
We're gonna be kings.

15
00:01:02,877 --> 00:01:03,877
What's up?

16
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:36,997
What you need?

17
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,665
Yo, you buyin', or are you
just stopping to envy?

18
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:49,103
Punk bitches.

Bounce, little man.
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,

22
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:44,692
getting eyeballed hard.

23
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:47,141
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

24
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,016
Get your ass up here now.

25
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,210
- What's that thing in your ear?
- What did I say? Get out of here!

26
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,325

www.forom.com
www.sub-way.fr

29
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,226
We've made such headway
with your treatments

30
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:12,501
that now it's time we talked
about sealing the deal.

31
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:13,782
Absolutely.

32
00:04:14,152 --> 00:04:15,333
As you know,

33
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,692
my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

34
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,758
That may no longer be the case.

35
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:27,006
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

36
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,468
Maybe a pretty good option.

37
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,549
Dr. Bravenec is one of the few surgeons
in the country

38
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:35,009
performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

39
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:37,525
He's got a good track record.

40
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:39,012
Pretty good.

41
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:41,519
It sounds...

42
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:44,528
aggressive.

43
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:46,854
Yes. Very much so.

44
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:50,095
Understand that if you
don't have this surgery,

45
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,393
you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

46
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:54,173
And it will.

47
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,883
Now, through the treatment you've had
already, we've bought you some time...

48
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,732
Maybe a lot, probably a little,

49
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:04,082
but that's all.

50
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:06,136
In my opinion,

51
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:09,025
if you're willing to take some risk,

52
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,412
then this offers the best chance.

53
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,906
How much would it cost?

54
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:21,989
I'm not on your insurance.

55
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,891
I'd say between 170,000

56
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:27,269
and 200,000, all in.

57
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:31,253
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can,

58
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:33,498
but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

59
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:39,801
This is obviously a big decision.

60
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:43,986
And you folks are gonna
want to take some time to discuss it.

61
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:47,846
I'll do it.

62
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,245
Don't you think we should at least
talk this through first?

63
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,108
I just think it's the way to go.

64
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:07,768
I have to say I think

65
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,552
it's the right choice.

66
00:06:11,182 --> 00:06:15,154
I recommend that we let the pneumonitis
heal for another couple of weeks,

67
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,778
and then we'll have at it.

68
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:21,379
That's tricky.

69
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:27,148
- When's the due date?
- It's the 21st.

70
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:29,449
So two weeks and change?

71
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:31,710
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

72
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:34,929
That way, Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

73
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:37,848
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

74
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,185
14 messag...

75
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:02,405
God.

76
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:07,995
It's me.

77
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,170
<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

78
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:12,738
Working.

79
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:14,367
What is it?

80
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,021
Combo's dead.

81
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,906
Shot.

82
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:24,378
Which one is he?

83
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:27,497
You did not just say that to me.

84
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,850
- Jesse, listen...
- That figures.

85
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,165
What's the word on the street?

86
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,932
No one's dropping no names.

87
00:07:47,398 --> 00:07:50,404
Combo rang me before it went down.
Said dudes were mad-dogging him,

88
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:53,882
trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

89
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:59,094
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean,

90
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,464
what'd you expect?

91
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,316
I don't know.

92
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:05,944
You don't know?

93
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:08,986
Is that all you got?

94
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:12,834
I'll do right by Combo's people.

95
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:17,945
Make sure you bust up
your cell and toss it.

96
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:19,996
We'll figure it out.

97
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:24,837
I appreciate what
you're saying and all,

98
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,400
but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

99
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,843
I'm on probation, man.

100
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:34,143
Fast track to Los Lunas.

101
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,127
We're on the verge

102
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:41,158
of making some serious coin.

103
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,626
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

104
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:51,432
This game we playing, we don't got
the street cred to survive it.

105
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,908
Back when everyone thought you killed
Spooge, maybe we were doing okay,

106
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,383
but that whole...

107
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:00,310
thing to the head thing, the ATM?

108
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:02,977
His junkie bitch copped to it.

109
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:06,092
The whole town knows it wasn't you.

110
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,547
Everyone knows?

111
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:17,906
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know, man.

112
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,430
'Cause we like you and all.

113
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:22,655
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

114
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,640
We'll get by.

115
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:27,371
We'll make it.

116
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:29,007
Sorry, Jesse.

117
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,359
I'm out.

118
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:45,320
We have had a bit of a setback.

119
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:50,088
Sorry, that's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

120
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:53,397
- How about your fault? How about that?
- Don't lay that on me.

121
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:56,628
- You are in charge of distribution.
- You said expand the territory.

122
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:59,097
- That doesn't mean you become careless.
- Guys, guys!

123
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:02,203
Who do I look like, Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counselor.

124
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:05,005
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

125
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:07,272
Now, setback. Go.

126
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:10,750
One of our dealers was murdered.

127
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:16,201
It was some kind of turf dispute,

128
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:18,694
and apparently we lost.

129
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,479
And then everyone quit on us.

130
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:24,055
We have absolutely no distribution.

131
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:27,961
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

132
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,961
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

133
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:34,735
There's your silver lighting.

134
00:10:35,113 --> 00:10:37,705
How about you?
How's the health situation?

135
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,484
It's better.
Do you mind?

136
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:42,504
Better?

137
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,809
It's looking a little more positive.

138
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:54,486
I may have more time than I thought.

139
00:10:54,842 --> 00:10:55,942
Outstanding.

140
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:58,627
Now, as to your dead guy,

141
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:00,854
occupational hazard.

142
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,884
Drug dealer getting shot,

143
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,859
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

144
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:10,037
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

145
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:14,441
38 and change.

146
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:16,508
38 ounces? Grams?

147
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:17,912
Pounds.

148
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,384
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

149
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:24,822
Guys!

150
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,730
Why the long faces here?

151
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:30,124
You're sitting on a gold mine.

152
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:32,393
A gold mine we can't sell.

153
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:34,861
We need a proper infrastructure.

154
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:37,522
We need foot soldiers and dealers

155
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,531
on a street level
that are rock solid.

156
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,770
We need muscle,
and we need enforcers.

157
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:44,939
Payback.
That's what we need.

158
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,084
God.

159
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:56,291
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

160
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:03,824
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

161
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,040
We need your help.

162
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:10,942
Let's start with some
tough love, all right?

163
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,877
Ready for this?
Here goes.

164
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:15,436
You two suck at peddling meth.

165
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:16,516
Period.

166
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:19,758
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

167
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:22,133
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

168
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,540
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

169
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:29,333
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

170
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,025
What?
Some tattooed speed-freak?

171
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:35,614
What you two need is
an honest-to-God businessman.

172
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:37,583
Somebody who treats your product

173
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,794
like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

174
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:44,686
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

175
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:49,054
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

176
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,187
You know someone like that?

177
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:55,435
Let's just say I know a guy

178
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,860
who knows a guy.

179
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,220
Who knows another guy.

180
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:03,026
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

181
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:07,025
Well, what's his name?

182
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:09,982
I have no idea.

183
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:12,822
He's very low profile.

184
00:13:12,947 --> 00:13:14,597
He's careful like that.

185
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:18,098
From what I do hear about him,

186
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,241
he sounds a little like you.

187
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,902
I need you to leave.

188
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,511
Look, there's...

189
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,984
some stuff about me
you don't know, and...

190
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:00,838
Like you're a drug dealer?

191
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:04,156
I kind of got that.

192
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:08,481
You pay in cash,
and you use an alias, so...

193
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:17,373
One of my guys,

194
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:21,216
a friend who worked for me...

195
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:24,231
got murdered.

196
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,402
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

197
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:32,391
I'm gonna smoke some crystal,

198
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:36,218
and I just think you should go,
being that you're

199
00:14:36,538 --> 00:14:38,412
in a program and all and...

200
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,584
You could come with me to a meeting.

201
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,612
No meetings.

202
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:53,723
We could just get out of here.

203
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:00,231
- It won't help.
- Yeah, it will.

204
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:03,737
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

205
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:05,031
I just...

206
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,477
All right, I really
just need you to go.

207
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:16,417
Sir?

208
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:17,972
Enjoy your meal.

209
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:51,717
You're late.

210
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,765
We're in the big time now.

211
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,461
So where's the kingpin?

212
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,630
Your guess is as good as mine.

213
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:09,923
So you get the dude's name?

214
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,039
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names,

215
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:18,494
what we look like,
but not the other way around?

216
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,700
Why don't you
get yourself some food?

217
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:29,247
So we won't both sit here with our Happy
Meals, looking like a couple chumps?

218
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:32,041
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

219
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:33,722
Fine, thanks.

220
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,360
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

221
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:41,278
I don't get you, man.

222
00:17:41,585 --> 00:17:45,135
A week ago you talked
like you were all ready to hang it up.

223
00:17:46,642 --> 00:17:49,817
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

224
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:51,849
What about after?

225
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:55,239
After, you gonna make up
some new magic number?

226
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:58,277
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

227
00:17:58,402 --> 00:18:00,602
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

228
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,289
- Things have changed.
- Oh, I know.

229
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,653
We got a guy killed.

230
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:11,711
You know what?

231
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,842
This is bullshit.

232
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:17,156
I'm out of here.

233
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,095
I think she's waking up from a nap.

234
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:34,528
She is certainly going to want
to get out and stretch those legs soon.

235
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:42,870
We'll keep an eye on your fluids.
You're on the low side of normal.

236
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:44,849
What? How low?

237
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,015
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

238
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,118
We'll just have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

239
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:57,921
Oh, man, you would
not believe the traffic.

240
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,239
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

241
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:01,169
Sorry.

242
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:04,800
- What did I miss?
- For your refrigerator.

243
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,920
Oh, my God.

244
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:08,486
Look at her.

245
00:19:08,804 --> 00:19:09,609
Look.

246
00:19:10,462 --> 00:19:13,065
God. It's like she's here already.

247
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:16,321
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

248
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:19,299
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

249
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,242
It's time to make a decision.

250
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,501
- You know what I'm going to say?
- The C-section?

251
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:27,299
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

252
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:32,251
My last labor was
pretty tough, so...

253
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:36,499
For the baby, I say yes.

254
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,285
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

255
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,242
It's best
we take her a little early.

256
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,567
So why don't we schedule it for...

257
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:45,474
a week from Friday?

258
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,179
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

259
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:56,287
We have a birthday.

260
00:19:57,286 --> 00:19:58,286
The 16th.

261
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:00,087
I like it.

262
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,477
You know, speaking of birthdays,

263
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:08,107
I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

264
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:10,597
It's an hour before closing.

265
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,598
You're supposed
to be taking it easy.

266
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:16,111
We're having a little get-together
for Ted's birthday

267
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:18,356
and I've got to pick up the cake.

268
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:19,400
Why you?

269
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:23,528
Because I said I would.

270
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:26,614
It's the least I can do.

271
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,287
Let's get out of here.

272
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,510
You know, go do something.

273
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:27,459
Seriously.

274
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,660
You know that museum
in Santa Fe you talked about?

275
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:33,921
Let's take a drive.

276
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:39,488
Sure.

277
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:01,582
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's already been drilled and cut,

278
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,707
We're halfway through the job.

279
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:06,305
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.</i>

280
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:12,624
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

281
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:13,799
I gotta go.

282
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,140
Dean, I gotta go.

283
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,292
Happy Birthday!

284
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,888
My God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

285
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:32,850
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

286
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:34,975
Wait a minute.

287
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,900
Are you making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

288
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:40,933
Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

289
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:44,153
China's undercutting us at every turn...
I'm at a loss.

290
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,425
Wait.

291
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:50,784
I want to hear it first.

292
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:53,405
Absolutely not.
No way.

293
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,011
You cannot deny
your employer his birthday wish.

294
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:58,667
- Yes, I can. Watch me.
- Please!

295
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,953
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

296
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:06,342
- Come on. It was so good last time.
- It was ages ago.

297
00:23:07,384 --> 00:23:09,467
And I'm enormous now.

298
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:11,844
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

299
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:14,350
Not that I ever did.
I mean, come on.

300
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,977
You guys, these candles
are getting wax all over the place.

301
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:19,515
- Seriously.
- Yes, come on, Skyler.

302
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,751
It's obscene.

303
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,833
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

304
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:42,711
<i>To you</i>

305
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,807
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

306
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:49,195
<i>To you</i>

307
00:23:51,073 --> 00:23:53,858
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

308
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:57,194
<i>Mr. President</i>

309
00:23:57,798 --> 00:24:01,372
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

310
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:06,464
<i>Happy Birthday</i>

311
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:09,750
<i>To you</i>

312
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,680
That was fantastic.

313
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,673
Isn't she great, huh?

314
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:20,967
Okay, here we go.

315
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:34,263
- He wasn't there.
- <i>He was there all right.</i>

316
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:38,591
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours. Nobody came.

317
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:41,258
<i>All I know is my contact
says he was there.</i>

318
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:43,843
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

319
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:45,696
Yes, I'm positive.

320
00:24:45,864 --> 00:24:47,398
- Where was he?
- <i>Who knows?</i>

321
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:49,333
Maybe he stayed out
in the parking lot,

322
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:52,477
checked you out with a telephoto lens.
Didn't like the cut of your jib.

323
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:53,464
Anyway,

324
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:56,743
it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no go.

325
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,413
What?
What do you mean?

326
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:01,244
No deal. No dice.

327
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,125
Shot at and missed, shit on and hit.

328
00:25:03,823 --> 00:25:07,552
Wait a minute. How can he make
that decision without even meeting me?

329
00:25:07,677 --> 00:25:10,591
<i>I told you he's very cautious
who he does business with.</i>

330
00:25:10,822 --> 00:25:14,454
All right?
He's skittish, like a deer.

331
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:18,468
Call him back.

332
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,769
<i>I'm sorry.
I can't do that.</i>

333
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:23,470
Yes, you can.
Call him, Saul.

334
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:26,282
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

335
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:28,731
I called a guy who called
a guy who called a guy.

336
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:30,277
Second of all, it's over.

337
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:33,252
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual,</i>

338
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:35,553
<i>all you get is the one shot.</i>

339
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:37,617
Look,

340
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:41,096
I'll see if I can scrape
something else together,

341
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:42,706
but don't get your hopes up.

342
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:45,404
<i>No one else handles
that kind of bulk.</i>

343
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:46,824
Damn it.

344
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:30,355
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

345
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,259
Can I help you, sir?

346
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:42,658
Diet Coke, please.

347
00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:47,654
And five minutes of your time.

348
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:00,573
What can I do for you?

349
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:01,595
Have a seat.

350
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,400
Please.

351
00:28:16,453 --> 00:28:20,053
I would like to know
why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.

352
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:24,469
I'm sorry.
I'm not following.

353
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,796
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

354
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
I believe that person was you.

355
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:36,129
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

356
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:38,882
I don't think I am.

357
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,069
Sir, if you have a complaint,

358
00:28:45,194 --> 00:28:47,406
I suggest you submit it through
our e-mail system.

359
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:50,040
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

360
00:28:51,637 --> 00:28:54,640
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with

361
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:56,065
is very careful.

362
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,420
A cautious man.

363
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,507
I believe we're alike in that way.

364
00:29:04,949 --> 00:29:05,742
If you are

365
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,050
who I think you are,

366
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:11,039
you should give me another chance.

367
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:18,964
I don't think we're alike
at all, Mr. White.

368
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,218
You are not a cautious man at all.

369
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,721
Your partner was late,
and he was high.

370
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:31,084
Yes, he was.

371
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:34,243
He's high often, isn't he?

372
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:39,887
You have poor judgment.

373
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,511
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

374
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:46,658
Are you familiar with my product?

375
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:49,754
I've been told it's excellent.

376
00:29:49,977 --> 00:29:51,372
It is impeccable.

377
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:53,592
It is the purest,

378
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:57,127
most chemically-sound product
on the market anywhere.

379
00:29:57,537 --> 00:29:59,691
That is not the only factor.

380
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:02,107
You could charge twice

381
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:06,232
the current rate for what I provide,
and your customers would pay it.

382
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,160
Hands down.

383
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,348
Now, who I choose to do business
with on my end

384
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:15,274
is not your problem.

385
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,338
You won't see him.

386
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,423
You won't interact with him.

387
00:30:21,727 --> 00:30:23,195
Forget he exists.

388
00:30:24,897 --> 00:30:26,313
I have to ask.

389
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:29,695
Why?

390
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:31,194
Why him?

391
00:30:34,357 --> 00:30:36,325
Because he does what I say.

392
00:30:38,624 --> 00:30:40,709
Because I can trust him.

393
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,591
How much product
do you have on hand?

394
00:30:45,454 --> 00:30:46,756
38 pounds.

395
00:30:47,643 --> 00:30:49,793
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

396
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:57,959
Will I hear from you?

397
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,108
I have your numbers.

398
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:09,191
You can never trust a drug addict.

399
00:31:25,272 --> 00:31:28,250
Look, I mean, it's all kind
of little dribs and drabs,

400
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:31,486
but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

401
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:34,761
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

402
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:36,605
Dribs and drabs.

403
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,511
Once you add it all up, though,
and with Keller,

404
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:42,752
the revenues are almost 10% less
than was actually received.

405
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:47,062
And this is every quarter,
for the last two years.

406
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:53,702
When I saw that, I got worried,
so I checked Accounts Receivable

407
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:57,104
on other customers.
I found six other instances

408
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:01,274
of revenues being under-reported.

409
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:05,331
And I've only just started
to look into it.

410
00:32:05,544 --> 00:32:08,899
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

411
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:11,349
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

412
00:32:11,474 --> 00:32:13,512
Most of the time, they overestimate.

413
00:32:13,637 --> 00:32:16,161
So I just let them roll their overages
into the next order

414
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:18,449
and if I don't,
they'll go elsewhere.

415
00:32:18,574 --> 00:32:20,125
Obviously, we forgot

416
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,732
or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

417
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:28,361
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see,

418
00:32:28,593 --> 00:32:31,593
the money's coming in.
Ventually, as you can see.

419
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:33,462
Right.

420
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,631
Right, but...

421
00:32:35,836 --> 00:32:39,754
I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage,

422
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,176
to try and sort this out.

423
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:48,381
And most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

424
00:32:49,856 --> 00:32:51,106
In a few cases,

425
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:56,352
I found Xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

426
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,450
All right.

427
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,950
You got me.

428
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:20,936
We're talking nearly a million
dollars of undocumented revenue.

429
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,779
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking

430
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,279
about saving a company.

431
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:29,855
I'm thinking about people's jobs,

432
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,973
about their mortgages and pensions

433
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:35,136
and their college
funds for their kids.

434
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:37,476
Not to mention my own.

435
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,974
It doesn't mean that you
have to break the law.

436
00:33:40,198 --> 00:33:41,348
Yes, it does.

437
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:44,089
It's right there in the books.
Business is terrible.

438
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:47,695
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

439
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,150
If I don't keep up...

440
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:51,813
People go to prison for this.

441
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,287
My dad built this
company from nothing.

442
00:34:03,196 --> 00:34:04,696
We make things here.

443
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,633
The people who work
here are like family.

444
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:12,369
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

445
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:22,215
Don't report this.

446
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,611
Please.

447
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:29,455
I'm not gonna turn you in.

448
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,016
But I can't be a part of it.

449
00:34:40,637 --> 00:34:41,487
I know.

450
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,239
I know. I just wish...

451
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:47,145
I'm sorry.

452
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:51,442
I don't want you to go.

453
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:11,972
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

454
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,494
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

455
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:17,447
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

456
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:21,526
<i>The whole crew was representing. Even
Badger came all the way from Fresno.</i>

457
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:23,885
<i>Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins,</i>

458
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,963
<i>everyone was all choked up and shit.</i>

459
00:35:26,088 --> 00:35:28,432
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

460
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:30,898
<i>And you should have seen the coffin.</i>

461
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:32,879
<i>It was like this shiny,
white pearlescent.</i>

462
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:36,392
<i>Like, I'm pretty sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

463
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:38,917
<i>So we're definitely
talking high-end.</i>

464
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:42,738
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

465
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:45,571
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

466
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:30,562
I like to mix some ice with it.

467
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:20,050
Hold that.

468
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,574
What's it feel like?

469
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:29,641
There's a chill.

470
00:37:31,312 --> 00:37:33,212
Don't freak out.
It passes.

471
00:37:34,149 --> 00:37:35,199
And then...

472
00:37:35,562 --> 00:37:36,634
you'll see.

473
00:37:41,403 --> 00:37:42,903
I'll meet you there.

474
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:55,772
Take that off.

475
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:25,970
Phones off, please.

476
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:45,860
Pipes, I guess.

477
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:49,427
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

478
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:51,506
Eyes on your paper.

479
00:41:22,787 --> 00:41:24,703
Excuse me, where's the manager?

480
00:41:24,828 --> 00:41:26,978
I'm the manager.
Can I help you?

481
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:33,638
I met a man here last week.
A black gentleman. He's thin. Glasses.

482
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:35,406
Yes, sir.
That's the owner.

483
00:41:36,902 --> 00:41:37,702
Owner.

484
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:40,637
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

485
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:42,812
He could be at any one of them.

486
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:47,652
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...

487
00:41:48,084 --> 00:41:50,588
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't give that out.

488
00:41:51,272 --> 00:41:55,222
Is this about a complaint? I'd be
happy to refer you to our website.

489
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:58,096
- What's his name?
- Gustavo.

490
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,160
Gus.

491
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:07,763
38 pounds, $1.2 million.

492
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:11,474
Truck stop,
2 miles south of exit 13 on the 25.

493
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,549
One hour.

494
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:14,512
- What?
- One hour. You in or out?

495
00:42:15,335 --> 00:42:18,743
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

496
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:20,762
One hour.
If you miss it,

497
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:23,437
don't ever show your face
in here again.

498
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:32,596
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck...

499
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:35,968
- Come on! Come on!
- <i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

500
00:42:37,117 --> 00:42:38,354
Pick up the phone.

501
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,331
Pick up the phone!

502
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:44,016
I'm coming by.
I need the product.

503
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,211
I need the product now!

504
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:50,469
Wake up!

505
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:55,555
Wake up.

506
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,480
Where'd you put it?

507
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,075
- Where is it? Where's the product?
- Get off of me.

508
00:45:05,565 --> 00:45:07,757
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

509
00:45:07,882 --> 00:45:09,487
- In the kitchen.
- Where?

510
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,489
Under the sink.

511
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:18,610
Not now!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
