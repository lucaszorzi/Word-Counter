00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:16,178
I got it, I got it.

3
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:17,279
Just--

4
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:19,548
You're like a bee
at a damn picnic, Marie.

5
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:21,483
Bzzz.
Good morning.

6
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:23,217
Hey, buddy.

7
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:25,019
Ready to get your rocks on?

8
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,220
See? I knew it.

9
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:28,490
"Mineral show" is just
some sort of guy code

10
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:29,958
for strip club.

11
00:01:29,992 --> 00:01:31,627
Hey, you got any singles?

12
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,396
- Got it?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,764
Yeah.

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,735
Don't let him
get too crazy, okay?

15
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,004
Cram one more giant geode
in here,

16
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:44,572
we'll be sleeping
in the garage.

17
00:01:44,607 --> 00:01:45,573
Got it.
I got it.

18
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:46,607
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,548
Christ.

20
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,182
Longest week ever.

21
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,953
I just hope we get
something good, you know?

22
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,854
Keep your fingers crossed.

23
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,962
Relax, buddy.
This ain't no spy movie.

24
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,900

What-- What-- But-- But--
What are you doing, buddy?

32
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:22,835
Leaving.

33
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,103
No, you got to go inside

34
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,371
and order something
like last time

35
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:26,539
to avoid suspicion.

36
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,342
Besides,
I want a vanilla shake.

37
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,878
We'll use the drive-through.

38
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:41,689
All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.

39
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:01,509
What the hell?

40
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:05,346
Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.

41
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,116
That's work, that's home,
that's work, that's home.

42
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,520
What, this guy goes
two places every day all week?

43
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:16,222
It's unbelievable.

44
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,757
Chicken-slinging
son of a bitch.

45
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,495
Hank, is it possible that...

46
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,431
maybe, just maybe...

47
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,500
he's not your guy?

48
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,369
Oh, a guy this clean's
got to be dirty.

49
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,341
What's the play here, buddy?

50
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,277
How do I get this guy?

51
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,147
Yeah.

52
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,615
How?

53
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:44,945
Yes, hi.

54
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,281
I live on the 4900 block
of Doswell Place,

55
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:51,384
and I want to report
a very suspicious man

56
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,353
who's lurking
in my neighborhood.

57
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:54,921
He's sitting in a blue Sedan,

58
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:57,424
and he-- He's been staring
at a particular house

59
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,791
for a very long time.

60
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,561
Thank you. Thank you so much.

61
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:04,264
If you would,
I would appreciate it.

62
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,797
All right.

63
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,932
So I guess we better
get started.

64
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,201
I already did.

65
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,206
Yeah?

66
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,680
Hey, uh...

67
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,320
You got one of those for me?

68
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:00,721
One of those what?

69
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,755
Cigarette.

70
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,461
Like, it's still in there,
all right?

71
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,329
I didn't get a chance yet.

72
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,235
Just give me one.

73
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:35,921
Hmm.

74
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,929
So what have you been up to?

75
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,497
What?

76
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,599
You know, just
a day in the life.

77
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,334
What do you do after work?

78
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,573
Go home, watch TV.

79
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,108
What do you watch?

80
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,977
I don't know. Stuff.

81
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,512
Like what?

82
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:05,051
Like, uh...

83
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,820
<i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

84
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,456
<i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

85
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,158
What happens on that one?

86
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:14,495
Guys drive on ice.

87
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:21,803
I am going to do it.

88
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,211
You got to inhale, by the way.

89
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,516
What the hell, man, don't you
have enough cancer already?

90
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,954
Look, I said...I'd do it.

91
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:44,623
I'll do it.

92
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:50,395
Yeah, well,
what does it matter?

93
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,664
We're both dead men anyway.

94
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:28,735
<i>Hi.</i>

95
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,003
Hi.

96
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:32,739
Am I, uh, catching you
at a bad time?

97
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,308
No, I have a few minutes.

98
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,310
So Mr. I'm Almost 16
So Leave Me Alone

99
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,979
doesn't want a big thing
for his birthday.

100
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,848
He just wants to hang out
with his friends,

101
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:43,350
which is fine by me. You?

102
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,718
Fine by me.

103
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:47,655
<i>Okay. So I figured, uh,</i>

104
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49,924
<i>low-key family dinner,
no official party,</i>

105
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,828
<i>and we bite the bullet and...</i>

106
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:55,597
buy him a car--

107
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:59,068
Uh, used, I was thinking,
would be best.

108
00:09:59,103 --> 00:10:00,937
But no more
than five years old.

109
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:04,240
Air bags, safety rated,
all that.

110
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,476
Do you, um, have any thoughts

111
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,944
on what kind,

112
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:10,847
or should I
just go ahead and--

113
00:10:10,881 --> 00:10:13,783
Yeah. No, you just go ahead.

114
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:14,951
<i>Okay.</i>

115
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:19,389
<i>Listen. On another subject,</i>

116
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:21,792
<i>I just wanted to tell you that</i>

117
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,127
business is good.

118
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,496
Really good.

119
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,700
So good that I'm thinking
maybe...

120
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:35,004
you don't even need
to work your second job.

121
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,046
You're turning a profit?

122
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,581
<i>We're coming close.</i>

123
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:45,883
Give us another month or two,

124
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:50,554
and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.

125
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:53,290
All of this to say

126
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:57,126
maybe you could start thinking
about an exit strategy.

127
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:02,199
I'm working on it.

128
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:06,170
Okay.

129
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,720
Hello.

130
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:38,422
<i>Hey, buddy. Wake you?</i>

131
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:42,860
No, Hank, I'm up.

132
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:45,896
Oh, good. Uh, what you doing?

133
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,731
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

134
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:49,199
Hey, listen,
I-I'll cut to it.

135
00:11:49,234 --> 00:11:50,634
I got another favor to ask.

136
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,135
<i>I've been thinking
about this Gus Fring, right?</i>

137
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,904
<i>How he never goes anywhere,</i>

138
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:55,472
<i>one restaurant, home,
one restaurant, home,</i>

139
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,707
<i>back and forth back and forth?</i>

140
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:57,908
<i>Which, now I'm even
more convinced</i>

141
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,510
<i>is bullshit, because
the man owns</i>

142
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,545
<i>13 other restaurants, right?</i>

143
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,581
So I started thinking about this
little empire of his, right?

144
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:06,216
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?

145
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:08,685
What's the base of operations?

146
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,088
So I do a little diggin',
and bingo!

147
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:13,957
Pollos Hermanos has
a main distribution center.

148
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:15,492
<i>Uh... It's not far from town.</i>

149
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,028
The place is huge.
I mean--

150
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:19,696
I'm looking at it
online right now.

151
00:12:19,731 --> 00:12:21,665
I tell you, it's
a big warehouse

152
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,235
and rows of these
long poultry buildings,

153
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,271
or hatcheries, or
whatever you call 'em.

154
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:30,107
<i>Lots of space to hide
illicit activity.</i>

155
00:12:30,141 --> 00:12:32,943
<i>Sounds promising, right?</i>

156
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,311
Huh.

157
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:36,313
<i>So. Whaddya say, buddy?</i>

158
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:39,483
<i>Got another field trip in you?</i>

159
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:40,550
Uhh...

160
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,721
You know, Hank. Um...

161
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:46,422
I mean, it sounds great.

162
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:48,990
It really does. But I--

163
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:51,693
You know, I won't lie, uh--

164
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:56,297
You caught me...
somewhat...

165
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:58,632
indisposed.

166
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,701
What do you mean, like
taking a dump indisposed?

167
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,805
Yeah. That's--

168
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,341
Embarrassingly, that's it.

169
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:10,711
You know, it's just...

170
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:12,279
upset stomach, you know,
and everything...

171
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:15,450
<i>- Yeah.
- It's out of control.</i>

172
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:17,752
Really explosive.

173
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:19,820
Bad Tex-Mex.

174
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:21,756
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,792
I get it. You don't have
to paint me a picture.

176
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:26,761
Probably one guy in a diaper
is enough for this trip anyway.

177
00:13:26,795 --> 00:13:28,596
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry, Hank.</i>

178
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,131
Hey, don't be.

179
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,599
I've been asking a lot
of you lately.

180
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:33,168
I appreciate it.

181
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:36,304
I'll find another
ride for this one.

182
00:13:36,338 --> 00:13:40,174
Another ride?

183
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,343
Yeah. I'm sure I can get
someone else to take me.

184
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:44,177
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.

185
00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:45,712
Maybe I'll ask him.

186
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:47,314
<i>Look, I'm-- I'm--</i>

187
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,849
<i>This is probably
just a 24-hour thing.</i>

188
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:52,151
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.

189
00:13:52,185 --> 00:13:53,786
And, um...

190
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,288
Do you think you could
possibly hold off

191
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:58,089
for a day or two?

192
00:13:58,124 --> 00:14:01,961
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-- You know--

193
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:03,529
<i>You know, I just--</i>

194
00:14:03,563 --> 00:14:04,964
<i>I would just really...</i>

195
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,601
love to be the one
to be able to--

196
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:09,503
to take you there, and--

197
00:14:09,537 --> 00:14:14,208
I mean, I have just
really enjoyed, you know,

198
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:16,211
the time with you,

199
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:19,448
<i>- and helping you.
- Well, yeah.</i>

200
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:21,950
Okay, sure. If it means
that much to you.

201
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,786
Just, you know, give me a call

202
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,454
when you're feeling
up to it, all right?

203
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:30,157
Thank you.
I will. Okay.

204
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:31,692
Bye.

205
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:55,084
<i>- Yeah.
- Uh, Mike.</i>

206
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:58,021
Listen. I just want to say,
first off,

207
00:14:58,055 --> 00:14:59,789
don't be angry.

208
00:14:59,823 --> 00:15:00,923
<i>What is it, Walter?</i>

209
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,392
My brother-in-law,

210
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:05,628
My DEA-- He--

211
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:08,097
Soon, he will probably,

212
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:10,967
in the near future,
take a ride out to

213
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,868
a certain distribution center,

214
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:16,338
to look around for things.

215
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,746
Look around for things.
And... Yeah.

216
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:28,116
Uh.

217
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:30,853
Mike?

218
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:52,108
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.

219
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:03,219
You're all set.

220
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,222
Thank you. Please give this
to your car care professional.

221
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,303
So. A hand wax
for you today?

222
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:23,172
Okay. Great.

223
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,612
Please give this to your
car care professional.

224
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:31,079
And the black Explorer?

225
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:33,415
Well, of course we could shampoo
your floor mats, but really,

226
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:35,683
deluxe detailing is
the best bang for your buck.

227
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:38,120
Oh, and SUVs are extra.

228
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:42,191
And please give this to
your car care professional.

229
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:43,525
Thank you!

230
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,595
Please give this to
your car care professional.

231
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:53,036
Hey, Sky.

232
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,306
Oh, my God.
Ted.

233
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:57,908
What are you, uh--

234
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,710
Someone from the office, uh,

235
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:02,079
said you worked down here,
so I thought I'd...

236
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:03,680
come down and say hi.

237
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:04,981
Wow. Well, uh...

238
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:07,883
Hello.

239
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:09,284
You look great.

240
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,687
No. I'm gonna like--

241
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:13,221
I probably just look crazed.

242
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:15,990
Not at all.
You look happy.

243
00:17:16,024 --> 00:17:17,759
Last time I saw you--

244
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:25,132
Hi, there.

245
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,634
Uh, thing is,

246
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:28,669
Skyler, um,

247
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:30,704
I really need to talk to you.

248
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:35,809
Ted,

249
00:17:35,844 --> 00:17:38,913
I really don't think we have
anything to talk about.

250
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:42,817
Actually, we do.

251
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:44,752
An audit?

252
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:49,424
Wait, an audit tomorrow?

253
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,660
How long have you had this?

254
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:54,262
Awhile. I'd...

255
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:56,398
debated, you know,
contacting you.

256
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:58,700
Contact me? What about
a lawyer? Ted--

257
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:01,403
Ted, this is--

258
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:02,905
This is the CID.

259
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:06,207
The Criminal Division.

260
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:10,178
My God, you facing
a felony charge here.

261
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,915
$100,000 fine
on top of the taxes

262
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:14,583
you already owe, plus

263
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:16,252
five years in prison!

264
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:18,220
Yeah. It's bad.

265
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:21,190
Yeah.
It most certainly is.

266
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,060
Look, here's the thing.

267
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:27,798
I was wondering, maybe, if um,

268
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:29,466
there's some way
you could help with this.

269
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:33,738
Help? Help how?

270
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:37,076
Well, with your knowledge
of how the books

271
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,245
got the way they are,
maybe there's some way

272
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,180
you could, uh,

273
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:43,615
undo what's in there.

274
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,919
You want me to
uncook your books?

275
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:49,754
Maybe there's some method,
or some accounting trick

276
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:52,457
- you could, you know, use--
- Ted.

277
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:54,426
It doesn't work like that.

278
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,895
The damage is already--

279
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:05,303
My name. My signatures

280
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:08,505
are all over those books.

281
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,941
Skyler, I'm accountable,
not you.

282
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,710
Let me explain what's
gonna happen here, okay?

283
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:17,280
Once the CID sees this
as willful tax fraud,

284
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:19,382
there are going to build
the strongest possible case

285
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,951
against you, and once
they start down that path,

286
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:24,687
they have an 80%
conviction rate.

287
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:28,057
That's because they're allowed
to monitor your mail,

288
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:32,328
and tap your phones--
and not just you, Ted.

289
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:35,498
Everyone involved
in those books.

290
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:41,504
I can't have this in my life.

291
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:44,140
I cannot be audited.

292
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:45,441
Skyler, you-- you--

293
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,076
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.

294
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:51,346
It's the captain they want,
not some cashier at a car wash.

295
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:56,951
No offense. I'm sorry.

296
00:19:56,985 --> 00:20:00,354
I, uh,

297
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,657
I don't want you
to worry, okay?

298
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:06,361
I'm gonna figure out
a way through this.

299
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:08,330
Somehow. Okay?

300
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:20,377
Here.

301
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:21,978
Right here.

302
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:40,029
So is he gonna kill him?

303
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:45,668
Is who gonna kill who?

304
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,006
Gus.

305
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,575
Is he gonna kill
Mr. White's brother-in-law?

306
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,116
I mean, he's the reason
for all this here, right?

307
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:06,723
Because it's totally logical
for him to off the dude.

308
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:11,828
A-hole DEA agent,

309
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,797
pokin' around your junk--

310
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,701
Who needs that, right?

311
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:22,806
Makes sense
to get rid of him...

312
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:25,476
for good.

313
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:33,351
But killing a cop--

314
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:36,720
I don't know.

315
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,290
It could look suspicious
if, uh,

316
00:21:39,324 --> 00:21:41,659
the dude who's
investigating you

317
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,728
suddenly up and dies.

318
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,670
Then there's--
There's Mr. White.

319
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,108
Who'd be even more ape shit

320
00:21:56,143 --> 00:22:01,046
if he had family
getting murdered.

321
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:06,985
He'd never cook for Gus again.

322
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:17,260
Guess there's a lot
of angles to consider.

323
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,332
If something were
to happen to the man,

324
00:22:23,367 --> 00:22:25,401
would you have
a problem with that?

325
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:33,242
Who really cares what I think?

326
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:30,633
Son of a bitch!

327
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,203
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.

328
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:51,655
- Hey.
- Get down!

329
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:51,468
<i>Sí.</i>

330
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,986
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.

331
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:50,093
So what? Is this going
to be a regular thing now?

332
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:52,596
Meth cooking
and corpse disposal? Jesus.

333
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,433
Just grab us
a spare barrel, Walter.

334
00:25:57,937 --> 00:25:59,136
What was it this time?

335
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:02,540
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gus?

336
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:04,609
Or did Gus just need
to send another message?

337
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,978
Shut your mouth.

338
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:09,680
You shut your mouth,
or I'll shut it for you.

339
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:11,582
I don't want you talking
to me or Jesse.

340
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:13,517
Just get the barrel.

341
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:17,087
And if you ever plan
on calling the cops

342
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:20,323
on one of my guys again,

343
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:22,992
you go ahead
and get two barrels.

344
00:27:00,431 --> 00:27:03,133
Yo, like, uh,

345
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:06,570
I guess I never thanked you for

346
00:27:06,604 --> 00:27:08,138
what you did.

347
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:11,409
Thanks.

348
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:17,081
Next time, don't stand there
like an idiot.

349
00:27:17,116 --> 00:27:20,185
Move your feet,
run and so forth.

350
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:23,455
But seriously,
what--

351
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:24,822
What was the deal with Gus?

352
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:28,259
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?

353
00:27:28,293 --> 00:27:30,260
Walking right into the bullets?

354
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:33,129
What the hell was he doing?

355
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:35,698
The cartel needs Gus.

356
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:37,266
His distribution network.

357
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:38,968
They're not looking
to kill him.

358
00:27:39,002 --> 00:27:42,571
But what? The rest of us
are like, open season?

359
00:27:42,606 --> 00:27:44,139
Is he doing anything
about that?

360
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:45,441
Or do we just keep hanging out

361
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:46,775
for target practice
while he's--

362
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:48,510
Kid.

363
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:52,081
Enough. You got questions,

364
00:27:52,115 --> 00:27:53,382
ask him yourself.

365
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:10,201
And here again.
Unreported income.

366
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:14,073
That's more than
a year straight so far.

367
00:28:14,107 --> 00:28:15,608
Do you want to say
something about this?

368
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:18,578
Because I'm having
a hard time figuring it out.

369
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:22,649
Well, I-- I'd have to, um,

370
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:24,751
have a look at the copies
of the receipts

371
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:26,352
to refresh my memory.

372
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:28,220
Take all the time
you need, Mr. Beneke.

373
00:28:28,254 --> 00:28:30,322
That's why we're here.

374
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:37,962
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.

375
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:39,496
I got lost.

376
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:41,665
- Hey, Ted.
- Sky.

377
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,800
Whoo!

378
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:45,169
This building is so confusing.

379
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:46,570
There are doors everywhere.

380
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:48,306
Hi. You are--

381
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,140
Special Agent James Bekaris.

382
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:51,943
Ooh. Special.

383
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:54,145
Skyler White.

384
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,015
Ms. White. You are
the accountant

385
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:58,717
of record for many
of these reports.

386
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:00,319
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.

387
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:02,287
Well then, perhaps you can
shed some light

388
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:04,156
on this history
of missing revenue.

389
00:29:04,191 --> 00:29:05,925
Missing?
Uh-huh.

390
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,961
- No, it's there.
- No.

391
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:10,564
Revenue most definitely
flowed through this company.

392
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,800
But it's not all accounted for
in your reports.

393
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,370
Huh!

394
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:21,043
Hmm, let's take a look.

395
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:22,677
Hmm. Oh.

396
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:25,379
Well, you know,
this account here?

397
00:29:25,414 --> 00:29:27,448
That is Mr. Keller's account,

398
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:30,284
and Mr. Keller's
an old friend of Ted's dad,

399
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:32,886
and he always sends
an electronic payment,

400
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,021
which personally I hate,

401
00:29:34,055 --> 00:29:35,723
because
I'm a real paper person,

402
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,525
but Mr. Keller's one
of those environmental people.

403
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,860
So anyway, since there
wasn't a physical check,

404
00:29:40,895 --> 00:29:43,630
I didn't enter it
into the book, but...

405
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:45,765
the money's there.

406
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:50,204
Ms. White, you've read
Section 61 of the IRC?

407
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:53,373
I... did not follow
what you just said.

408
00:29:53,408 --> 00:29:57,478
How gross income for a
business is defined.

409
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:59,514
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.

410
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,115
No, you're not.

411
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,218
Well, you know what they say
about opinions, right?

412
00:30:03,252 --> 00:30:06,187
Everyone's got one.

413
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,857
But seriously, I am.

414
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,759
Look, it doesn't matter
if its an electronic check

415
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:13,128
or a paper check,
income is income.

416
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:15,264
You're not allowed
to not declare it.

417
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,668
When I input everything
into the Quicken,

418
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:21,137
nothing flashed red,
so that's gotta mean

419
00:30:21,171 --> 00:30:24,106
it's okay, right?

420
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,208
Quicken.
Uh-huh.

421
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:28,943
You used Quicken
to manage books

422
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:30,611
for a business this size.

423
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:32,613
I did. Oh, do you guys
use that here?

424
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:34,214
'Cause it is the best.

425
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,451
It's like having a calculator
on your computer. Amazing.

426
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:39,419
Ms. White, how did you
get this job?

427
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:41,288
- Oh, Ted hired me.
- No.

428
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,824
I mean your qualifications.

429
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:45,059
What are your qualifications?

430
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,694
Where did you
get your training?

431
00:30:46,729 --> 00:30:50,065
Ooh, well I haven't had
any training per se,

432
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,634
I've always been naturally
good with numbers.

433
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:54,536
Got a good instinct for them.

434
00:30:54,571 --> 00:30:56,372
Right, Teddy?

435
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,778
Right.

436
00:31:01,812 --> 00:31:05,648
This is all falling
into place now.

437
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,120
Ms. White,
I just have to ask.

438
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:15,390
You're not managing accounts
anywhere else, are you?

439
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,459
Right now? No.

440
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:19,527
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

441
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,534
I'm not really clear about
what happened in there.

442
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,971
What happened is good news.

443
00:31:28,005 --> 00:31:30,374
Ignorance of the law does
not equate to criminality.

444
00:31:30,408 --> 00:31:32,343
It equates to ignorance.

445
00:31:32,377 --> 00:31:35,446
Look, pay your back taxes,
pay the penalties,

446
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,715
and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.

447
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,951
Pay with what?

448
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:42,086
I owe them $617,000.

449
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,854
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.

450
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:47,091
All right? You just
dodged prison.

451
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,759
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW,

452
00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:51,261
take out a second
mortgage on your house.

453
00:31:51,295 --> 00:31:53,129
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.

454
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,397
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets

455
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:57,432
- left to sell.
- Ted.

456
00:31:57,467 --> 00:32:00,668
If you don't pay them, they
will reopen the investigation.

457
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:03,405
And that little fiction
I just spun up there

458
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:05,507
will completely unravel.

459
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,642
You have to settle.

460
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,013
Wish I could.

461
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:01,663
Come in.

462
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,814
I hope you brought an appetite.

463
00:33:21,217 --> 00:33:23,018
Yeah. I guess.

464
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:29,625
Mike mentioned
you have some questions.

465
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:36,265
Yeah.

466
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:39,936
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.

467
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,477
Right on.

468
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,191
What am I doing here?

469
00:34:13,236 --> 00:34:15,603
I know you have concerns.

470
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:18,506
What happened yesterday

471
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,241
to my man at the farm--

472
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,910
It was a terrible thing.

473
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:25,948
Oh, the dude getting
his head blown off? Yeah.

474
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:29,653
I have invited you
into my home,

475
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:31,788
prepared food,

476
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:34,525
so we could sit and talk.

477
00:34:37,263 --> 00:34:40,498
Discuss what's going on
in this business,

478
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:43,568
our business, like men.

479
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:47,304
And I will explain
everything that's happening.

480
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,473
I will answer your questions.

481
00:34:49,508 --> 00:34:54,144
But first, I need you...

482
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:57,380
to answer one question for me.

483
00:34:59,149 --> 00:35:01,317
Can you cook Walter's formula?

484
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,855
What?

485
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,624
Walter's formula.

486
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:10,193
Can you produce this product?

487
00:35:10,227 --> 00:35:13,664
Without any help, alone?

488
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:15,899
No.

489
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:19,670
Why?

490
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:24,242
You asking me if I can
cook Mr. White's crystal?

491
00:35:24,276 --> 00:35:29,114
Without him? Me?

492
00:35:29,148 --> 00:35:31,116
The junkie loser
you were about to waste

493
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,551
and dump in the desert
a month ago?

494
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:36,421
This is your plan, huh?

495
00:35:36,455 --> 00:35:41,827
Invite me in your house,
make whatever this is,

496
00:35:41,861 --> 00:35:46,465
be my buddy and--
And make me feel

497
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:48,567
important,

498
00:35:48,601 --> 00:35:52,504
then get me to keep
cooking for you

499
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:55,007
after you kill Mr. White.

500
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:59,879
You want to-- You want
to talk like men?

501
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:01,280
Let's talk like men!

502
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:05,518
You kill Mr. White, you're
gonna have to kill me too.

503
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:08,754
That is not what I asked you.

504
00:36:08,788 --> 00:36:11,257
You are here

505
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:14,193
because circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

506
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:16,462
And I need your help.

507
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,432
I need you to help prevent
an all-out war.

508
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:25,304
Now, if you would,

509
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:27,706
answer the question.

510
00:37:28,084 --> 00:37:31,118
Hey, you, uh--
You headed out?

511
00:37:33,455 --> 00:37:35,624
Yeah.

512
00:38:19,768 --> 00:38:22,036
<i>Yo, Mr. White. Hey, uh,</i>

513
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,838
<i>I really got to talk to you.
I-- I don't know</i>

514
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:25,639
<i>if you're with
your family or whatever,</i>

515
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:29,810
<i>but this is important,
so I'm hoping</i>

516
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:32,680
<i>you could come over.</i>

517
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,223
Thank God. Come on in.

518
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,395
You uh--
You want a beer?

519
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:49,597
- Or something?
- No.

520
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,466
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

521
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,302
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.

522
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:56,838
Okay, so, um--

523
00:38:56,872 --> 00:38:58,506
Okay. So...

524
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,009
word has come
down that they--

525
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:05,046
They want me to go to Mexico.

526
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,316
There's some sort
of war brewing

527
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,885
between Gus and the cartel.

528
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,354
"Word has come down?"

529
00:39:12,388 --> 00:39:16,358
Yeah, the cartel has been
messing with Gus's operation.

530
00:39:16,392 --> 00:39:18,426
Like jacking trucks
to like, send a message,

531
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,829
and you know, yesterday,
that dude

532
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:22,230
we brought to the lab?

533
00:39:22,265 --> 00:39:24,833
I mean, they shot him
right in front of me.

534
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:27,202
Just blew his head open.

535
00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:29,872
Some sniper nailed him
from like a mile away.

536
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,943
Anyway, they've been
holding them off,

537
00:39:34,977 --> 00:39:38,346
but between the cartel
taking pot shots

538
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:40,615
and your brother-in-law
trying to throw a net

539
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:43,150
over the whole deal, it's
like, what do you call,

540
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:45,886
a rock and a hard place
situation.

541
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,324
So Gus is gonna cave.

542
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:52,760
So the cartel wants half

543
00:39:52,794 --> 00:39:55,329
of Gus' entire operation,
and they want

544
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:58,232
your formula, and he's
gonna give it to them.

545
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:00,567
Well, I-- I gotta
give it to them.

546
00:40:00,602 --> 00:40:02,769
I mean, I'm supposed
to go to Mexico

547
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:05,606
and teach a bunch of
cartel chemists

548
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,641
how to cook a batch of blue.

549
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:11,278
You know, Gus doesn't
trust you, so...

550
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:14,548
I gotta go-- I mean,
you're the chemist, man!

551
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:16,149
You know, not me.

552
00:40:16,183 --> 00:40:17,617
Let's say I go down

553
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:20,819
to, you know, go over there,
go to the jungle

554
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:22,454
or-- Or whatever.

555
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,890
You know, and say they got,
like, actual chemists,

556
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:28,660
like cartel chemists,
asking me chemistry stuff

557
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:31,329
that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you?

558
00:40:31,364 --> 00:40:33,065
And what if, like,
all the equipment

559
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,769
is uh, is in Mexican,
instead of English?

560
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:39,105
You know? Oh!

561
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:41,041
I don't know.
I don't know.

562
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:44,178
I mean, if I mess this up,

563
00:40:44,212 --> 00:40:46,313
I am dead, you know?

564
00:40:46,348 --> 00:40:48,449
All of us!

565
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:54,822
So I-- Look, I--
I need your help.

566
00:40:54,856 --> 00:40:56,890
Okay, maybe you could--

567
00:40:56,925 --> 00:40:59,326
Maybe you could, like, coach me

568
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,494
or something, you know?

569
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:03,863
Or you can give me some notes.

570
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:07,166
Mr. White.

571
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,001
So you saw Gus?

572
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:12,538
What? No.

573
00:41:12,572 --> 00:41:15,842
You didn't see Gus.
No.

574
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:19,213
Then who told you all of that?

575
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:22,249
It was passed down,
like I said.

576
00:41:22,284 --> 00:41:25,586
Passed down?

577
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,255
By whom?

578
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:29,624
By, uh...
By Mike and them.

579
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:30,825
They did. They--

580
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:33,627
So "they" doesn't include Gus.

581
00:41:33,661 --> 00:41:35,662
You haven't been with Gus.

582
00:41:35,697 --> 00:41:38,498
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.

583
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,633
Why are you...

584
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,068
You weren't at Gus's house
last night.

585
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:44,171
What?

586
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,908
What the hell?

587
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:50,410
J-Jesus--

588
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:51,611
It's still here.

589
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:55,882
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.

590
00:42:00,722 --> 00:42:03,758
You look me in the eye
and you tell me

591
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:06,394
that you weren't at
his house last night.

592
00:42:07,396 --> 00:42:10,599
I, um...

593
00:42:10,633 --> 00:42:12,334
Look, I didn't have a chance.

594
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:14,403
All right?

595
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:16,740
Okay, I knew you would
react this way.

596
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:18,608
I knew you would freak out

597
00:42:18,643 --> 00:42:19,810
and wouldn't
believe me--

598
00:42:19,844 --> 00:42:23,381
That's why I didn't
say anything.

599
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,617
Look, there was just this
one big pot of stew, okay?

600
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,286
He just made this one big pot,

601
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,821
and we both ate from it--
What was I supposed to do?

602
00:42:30,855 --> 00:42:31,955
Huh? Poison myself?

603
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:34,224
Two hours and 18 minutes,

604
00:42:34,258 --> 00:42:36,359
and you couldn't figure out
a way to give it to him.

605
00:42:36,393 --> 00:42:38,595
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!

606
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:41,531
You had one thing to do!

607
00:42:41,565 --> 00:42:44,399
One thing! That is
the only thing, I might add,

608
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:46,701
that would save our lives.

609
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:49,504
Right there.
You were in his house!

610
00:42:49,538 --> 00:42:51,506
And you didn't have
the guts to do it.

611
00:42:55,978 --> 00:42:59,114
Two hours and 18 minutes?

612
00:42:59,148 --> 00:43:01,483
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

613
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:05,654
How did you know I was
at his house last night?

614
00:43:05,688 --> 00:43:06,989
Were you following me?

615
00:43:10,793 --> 00:43:13,928
This.
This is how I knew.

616
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:20,034
You bugged my car?

617
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:22,470
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.

618
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:24,238
Two hours and 18 minutes,

619
00:43:24,273 --> 00:43:26,374
but you had no intentions,
did you?

620
00:43:26,408 --> 00:43:29,711
Not the slightest intention.

621
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:31,680
Everything that
I have done for you--

622
00:43:31,714 --> 00:43:34,983
You put a bug on my car?

623
00:43:35,017 --> 00:43:38,054
I'm sorry. After everything
you've done for me?

624
00:43:38,088 --> 00:43:40,323
What you've done for me?

625
00:43:40,357 --> 00:43:42,392
You've killed me
is what you've done.

626
00:43:42,426 --> 00:43:44,227
You've signed my death warrant.

627
00:43:44,262 --> 00:43:46,029
And now you want advice?

628
00:43:46,064 --> 00:43:47,197
All right,
I'll give you advice.

629
00:43:47,232 --> 00:43:50,133
Go to Mexico and screw up,
like I know you will,

630
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:52,002
and wind up
in a barrel somewhere!

631
00:44:42,955 --> 00:44:44,356
Oh, God!

632
00:45:44,989 --> 00:45:47,257
Can you walk?

633
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:51,528
Yeah.

634
00:45:51,563 --> 00:45:55,332
You get the fuck out of here
and never come back.

635
00:46:09,778 --> 00:46:10,812
Ohh!
